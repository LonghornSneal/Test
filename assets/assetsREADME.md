assets/ (folder) – Contains static assets like images or videos used in the application content or UI.
images/ – Image files for icons and illustrations:
For example, arrow-right.png and arrow-down.png (or SVGs) to represent the expandable list arrows. The app might use a single arrow image and rotate it via CSS, but separate files or an icon sprite can be provided. These images are styled in the CSS (for size and color if not inherently blue) or inserted via <img> tags in the HTML where needed.
Other possible images include protocol diagrams or drug reference images that might appear in the detailed content sections. Each such image would be stored here and referenced in the HTML detail content or via <img src="assets/images/…"> tags.
Any logo or branding images for the app could also reside here.
videos/ – Video files (if any are packaged with the app). Typically, large videos might be streamed or embedded from external sources, but if small training clips or demonstrations are included offline, they would be in this folder. The HTML detail sections would use the <video> tag or external <iframe> (for YouTube, etc.). If using local video files, they would be referenced from this directory.
(Other assets) – If needed, other subfolders could exist (e.g., fonts/ for custom webfont files, or data/ for any static JSON files containing content like drug info). In this project, most reference data is likely hard-coded into the HTML or JS, so a dedicated data file may not be necessary. However, if the list of medications or protocols is very large, one might include a JSON or JS file with that data and load it for generating content or for search indexing.
