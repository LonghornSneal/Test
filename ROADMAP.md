# Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the milestone plan for delivering the first production-ready version of the new application. Dates are placeholders until the broader program schedule is confirmed.

## Milestone 1 – Discovery & Alignment
- Validate the core user problem through stakeholder interviews and market research.
- Document user personas, primary use cases, and measurable success metrics.
- Produce a lightweight technical feasibility assessment and identify key system integrations.

## Milestone 2 – Experience Definition
- Create wireframes and an interactive prototype that covers the end-to-end user journey.
- Run usability sessions to confirm the prototype solves the validated problems.
- Draft the initial information architecture, content strategy, and accessibility requirements.

## Milestone 3 – Technical Foundations
- Choose the target architecture, frameworks, and tooling for the implementation repository.
- Define API contracts, data models, and integration points with external services.
- Prepare the delivery backlog by breaking roadmap work into prioritized engineering tickets.

## Milestone 4 – Alpha Release Preparation
- Build the minimum viable feature set that exercises the primary user flows.
- Stand up continuous integration pipelines, automated testing baselines, and release procedures.
- Establish telemetry, error reporting, and feedback channels for early adopters.

## Milestone 5 – Launch Readiness
- Complete feature hardening, performance tuning, and accessibility audits.
- Deliver user documentation, training materials, and internal support playbooks.
- Conduct go/no-go reviews, finalize rollout plan, and schedule post-launch follow-up.

## Ongoing Initiatives
- Capture user feedback after each milestone to recalibrate priorities.
- Keep the roadmap synchronized with cross-functional dependencies (marketing, support, compliance).
- Update this document whenever milestones shift or scope changes.
