Manages the collapsible patient info sidebar:
- Collects user-entered data and stores it in `app.js`.
- Applies effects throughout the app, such as striking through text, showing warnings, and pre-calculating dosages using data from `data/medications.js`.
- Auto-collapses when the user clicks outside the sidebar.
