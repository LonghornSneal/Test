/*
  history.js â€“ Manages Back/Forward navigation and the history panel of visited topics.
  
  Responsibilities:
  1. Maintain an internal history of navigation states (topics viewed, plus the "home" state for main list).
     - Use data structures (e.g., arrays or stacks) to track the sequence of visited topic details and to enable back/forward movement.
     - Ensure that the history does not conflict with browser's own history (no external navigation, but optionally we could use History API).
     - Keep track of which state is current, what can be gone back to, and what is forward.
  2. Provide functions to navigate: goBack(), goForward(), goHome().
     - goBack(): move to the previous state (if available) and update the UI to show that state (either a detail or the main list).
     - goForward(): move forward to the next state if available and update UI.
     - goHome(): jump directly to the main list (initial state), clearing any forward history.
  3. Provide a function pushHistory(topicName) to record a new detail view state when a topic is opened.
     - This will add an entry to history (and clear forward history, as typical behavior).
     - Represent "home" (main list) as a special state (could be null or a keyword) that is not pushed but implicitly considered the base.
  4. Manage the History panel UI (#history-panel and #history-list).
     - When a new topic is viewed, add it to the #history-list (avoid duplicates in sequence if desired, or list each visit).
     - Provide a way to toggle the visibility of the history panel (e.g., via History button).
     - If history entries in the panel are clickable, handle their click to navigate directly to that entry (perhaps treated as a new navigation or actual history jump).
  5. Update the Back/Forward buttons' enabled/disabled state based on available history.
     - Disable Back if no previous state, disable Forward if no forward state.
     - This should be done whenever history changes (after push, back, forward, etc.).
  
  Predefined names & interactions:
  - Back button: #back-btn, Forward button: #forward-btn, Home button: #home-btn, History panel toggle: #history-btn.
  - Navigation functions: use navigation.showMainList() to show the main list (home state), and navigation.displayTopicDetail(topic) to show a detail without adding new history (when moving backward/forward).
  - The history is stored internally (not using window.history.pushState here, to keep it simple, though it could be extended to do so).
  - Use global arrays: e.g., historyStack (for back history) and forwardStack.
  - The #history-list in the panel displays topic names in the order they were visited (could be simply the historyStack plus current, or entire sequence including past).
  - On clicking a history entry (if implemented), we can navigate to that topic (either by simulating back/forward jumps or as a new detail open).
