history.js – Manages navigation history and session persistence of visited items. This script creates a seamless “back and forward” experience similar to a web browser history, and also provides a chronological list of accessed topics. Its functionality includes:
History stack for Back/Forward: As the user navigates through the app (expanding sections or opening detail views), history.js records these states. For example, when navigation.js opens a detail view, it would call a function in history.js to push that state (could be as simple as an identifier for the topic or an object describing which view to return to). The script maintains an array (or two stacks) to represent backward and forward history, enabling the Back and Forward buttons. When the Back button is clicked, history.js will determine the previous state, remove the current state from the stack (pushing it onto a forward stack), and instruct navigation.js to display the appropriate previous view (whether that’s reopening a detail or returning to the main list with certain expansions). Similarly, Forward will reapply a state from the forward stack. The script also handles disabling/enabling the Back/Forward buttons depending on availability of history states.
History list (persistent): In addition to immediate navigation history, history.js keeps a longer list of all distinct topics viewed, even across sessions. This corresponds to the History button’s scrollable list of previously accessed items. Each time a detail page is viewed (or perhaps whenever a leaf topic is clicked), history.js adds an entry (with timestamp or just in order) to a list. This list is stored in localStorage so it persists if the app is closed. On startup, history.js reads this list and can display recent items in the History panel UI. The history list might show the topic names as clickable entries.
History UI management: The script controls the showing/hiding of the history list dropdown or panel. When the user clicks the History button, history.js will populate the list (if not already populated) with the titles of topics from the stored history, sorted most recent first (with perhaps a limit to avoid too long a list). If the list is long, it can be scrollable within the panel. Each entry is clickable; clicking one will trigger navigation to that topic’s detail (via navigation.js). This likely also pushes a new state onto the back/forward history (since it’s a jump).
Coordination with other scripts: history.js works closely with navigation.js. It may call functions like navigation.showTopic(id) or navigation.openDetail(id) to effect changes in the UI when moving through history. Conversely, navigation.js (and search.js when initiating a jump) will call history.push(state) when a new navigation event occurs. Also, when the user clicks Back/Forward, history.js will update the UI state via navigation calls. All this is done without full page reloads (since it’s an SPA). Additionally, history.js might use the patient data context from patientData.js if needed (though likely history is more about navigation state; patient data changes wouldn’t typically create new history entries, except they persist globally).
Session persistence: By saving the history list and possibly the last viewed state in localStorage, history.js allows the app to onload restore some context if desired. For example, the app could optionally return to the last-viewed page on startup (though the prompt doesn’t state that explicitly, it mainly focuses on reusing input data and showing history list). The script ensures no privacy issues by only storing data locally on the user’s device (since it’s a static app with no backend).
