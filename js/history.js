/*
Manages navigation history and backward/forward traversal for the app:
- Maintains stacks of visited states for backward and forward navigation, enabling the app to return to a previous view or go forward after a back action.
- Provides functions like `goBack()` and `goForward()` that move the application to the previous or next state by calling navigation.js to update the displayed content, while updating the internal history stacks accordingly.
- Initializes the history controls via an `initHistory()` function, attaching click handlers to the history-related UI buttons (`#backButton`, `#forwardButton`, and `#historyButton`). It also updates the state of these buttons (e.g., disables #backButton if there is no history to go back to) based on the current history stacks.
- Manages the display of the history panel that lists visited topics: toggles the panel’s visibility when the History button is clicked and populates it with a chronological list of past topics. Each entry in this list is made clickable, and selecting one will invoke navigation to that specific topic (using navigation.js functions just as a normal navigation would).
- On startup, loads any previously saved history data from localStorage so that a user’s past session (recently viewed topics and navigation state) can be restored. This ensures that the Back/Forward buttons and history list reflect the user’s history even after a page reload.
