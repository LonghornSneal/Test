  main.js – Orchestrates initial UI setup and event handlers, tying together all components.
  
  Responsibilities:
  1. Initialize the application once the DOM is fully loaded, calling initialization functions from other modules (patientData, navigation, search, history).
  2. Ensure that scripts execute in the correct order (this file is last, so by now global variables and functions from other files are available).
  3. Set up any remaining event listeners that were not already set in their modules (if any cross-module interactions need binding).
  4. Handle any startup logic, such as showing the initial view (topics list) and possibly loading any saved state (like a remembered last topic or patient data if needed).
  5. Overall, coordinate interactions:
     - e.g., when a new detail is shown via navigation, main.js doesn't need to do much since navigation.js and history.js handle their parts.
     - But main.js ensures all components are started and can interact (like search input events calling nav functions, etc.).
  
  Steps on load:
  - Wait for DOMContentLoaded event (or load event) to ensure HTML elements are present.
  - Call initializePatientData() to set up patient info management.
  - Call initializeNavigation() to populate the topics list and prepare category toggles.
  - Call initializeSearch() to prepare search suggestions and filtering.
  - Call initializeHistory() to attach history button events and set initial state of back/forward buttons.
  - If needed, display a welcome or default state (in this app, the default is just the topics list visible).
  - Ensure the main topics list (#topics-view) is visible and detail view is hidden (should already be via classes in HTML).
  - No conflicting actions: each init function does its own setup; main.js just triggers them in the proper order.

  // (Optional) If we wanted to restore the last viewed topic on load, 
  // we could check localStorage for a saved "lastTopic" and if present, automatically open it:
  // let lastTopic = localStorage.getItem("lastTopic");
  // if (lastTopic) { showTopicDetail(lastTopic); }
  // For now, we start at the main list view by default.

README Section for main.js (Revised)
The main.js file serves as the final initialization script for the Paramedic Quick Reference application. It is responsible for bootstrapping all app components once the DOM is fully loaded. In this non-modular architecture, main.js operates in the global scope – it does not use any import/export statements. Instead, it assumes that other script files (loaded before main.js via <script> tags) have already defined certain functions and data as globals. Role of main.js: It waits for the page to finish loading, then initializes the app’s features and user interface. This script expects specific global functions (provided by other JS files) to be available and calls them to set up the application. Key expected globals include:
initializeNavigation() – Sets up the navigation UI and event handlers (e.g., menu buttons, tab switches). This should be defined in a script that handles navigation logic.
initializePatientData() – Loads or initializes the patient reference data (or any core data set) that the app needs. This function is defined in a script responsible for managing patient data or reference info.
(Any additional initialization functions) – If the app has other components, main.js will similarly call their global init functions (for example, initializing UI components or loading stored settings).
How it works: main.js attaches a handler to the DOMContentLoaded event so that initialization runs only after the HTML is fully parsed. When triggered, it performs the following steps:
Initial UI State: It explicitly sets the starting UI state – for example, hiding any detail/info panels and showing the main list or home screen. This ensures the user sees a clean default view.
Invoke Global Initializers: It calls the global functions like initializeNavigation() and initializePatientData() (if they exist) to set up the app’s functionality. Each of these should configure specific parts of the app (navigation menus, data displays, event listeners, etc.).
Fallback Warnings: If any expected global function is missing (not defined), main.js will log a warning in the console. This helps in debugging by indicating a script might not have been loaded or a function name is mismatched.
Assumptions: The code assumes that required elements (such as the main list container and detail panel in the HTML) are present. Comments in the code note these assumptions and any default behaviors (e.g., what happens if no patient data is initially available).
By orchestrating startup in a single place, main.js ensures all components are initialized in the correct order without relying on module imports. All scripts share the global namespace, so naming should be unique to avoid conflicts. The following updated main.js code reflects this global, non-modular approach with thorough inline documentation.
Updated main.js (Global Scope Implementation)

Copy code
/* main.js – Entrypoint script for Paramedic Quick Reference app.
 * This script runs after all other scripts have loaded, and expects certain functions 
 * and variables to be defined globally (no module imports/exports).
 * 
 * Expected global functions (defined in other JS files loaded before this):
 *   - initializeNavigation() : set up navigation UI and event handlers.
 *   - initializePatientData() : load or prepare patient/reference data for the app.
 * (Ensure that files defining these functions are included via <script> tags before main.js)

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // --- Initial UI State Setup ---
  // For example, hide detailed info panels and show the main list panel on load.
  const detailsPanel = document.getElementById('detailsPanel');
  const mainList     = document.getElementById('mainList');
  if (detailsPanel && mainList) {
    detailsPanel.style.display = 'none';  // Hide detail view panel (if any)
    mainList.style.display     = 'block'; // Show main list or home view by default
  }
  // If the app uses different IDs or multiple panels, ensure the main view is visible.
  
  // --- Initialize Navigation Components ---
  if (typeof initializeNavigation === 'function') {
    // Set up navigation menus, buttons, and their event listeners (defined in navigation.js)
    initializeNavigation();
  } else {
    console.warn('Warning: initializeNavigation() is not defined. Did you include navigation.js?');
  }
  
  // --- Initialize Patient Data / Reference Data ---
  if (typeof initializePatientData === 'function') {
    // Load or set up patient data (e.g., reference info, default values)
    initializePatientData();
  } else {
    console.warn('Warning: initializePatientData() is not defined. Did you include patient-data.js?');
  }
  
  // (Optional) You can call other global initialization functions here, using the same pattern:
  // if (typeof initializeXYZ === 'function') initializeXYZ();
  
  // --- Final UI Updates (if any) ---
  // At this point, all initial data is loaded and UI components are set up.
  // You might trigger a default view update or welcome message here if needed.
});
Notes:
The code above avoids any ES6 module syntax. All functions are invoked directly in the global scope.
Inline comments clearly indicate which external scripts/functions main.js depends on.
By checking typeof func === 'function' before calling, it provides safe fallback behavior and console warnings, which help identify missing script files during development.
The initial UI state setup (hiding/showing elements) should be adjusted to match the actual element IDs/classes used in your HTML. This ensures the user starts with the intended default screen.
