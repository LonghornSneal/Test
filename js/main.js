/*
Orchestrates the application startup and overall state management:
- Waits for the DOM content to load, then triggers initialization of all modules.
- Calls each moduleâ€™s setup function (e.g., `initPatientDataPanel()`, `initNavigation()`, `initSearch()`, `initHistory()`) to prepare event handlers and UI interactions.
- Ensures all main UI controls are hooked up: sets up the search bar input (`#searchInput`), navigation buttons (`#backButton`, `#forwardButton`, `#homeButton`), the history toggle (`#historyButton`), and the patient info sidebar toggle (`#patientInfoToggle`) via the respective modules.
- Restores any saved state by delegating to other components (loading stored patient info and history data from localStorage through patientData.js and history.js).
- Coordinates cross-module updates so that the current view (selected topic detail, navigation history, patient context) remains consistent throughout the app.
