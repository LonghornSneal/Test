/*
Implements the search bar functionality for quick topic lookup:
- Monitors the search input field (`#searchInput`) as the user types, filtering the available topics and subtopics in real time.
- Initializes with an `initSearch()` function that prepares the search feature (e.g., compiling a list of all topic names or keywords from the content) and sets up the event listener for text input.
- Generates and updates a dropdown list of suggestions beneath the search field, showing topics that match the current query string (refreshing the list on each keystroke).
- Handles selection of a search suggestion: when a result is clicked or chosen via keyboard, the script navigates to that topic’s content by invoking the appropriate navigation function (for example, calling `navigation.openDetail(<topicId>)` to display the selected topic’s detail section).
- Ensures the suggestions UI is managed cleanly, hiding the dropdown when the search input is cleared or loses focus, and after a selection is made to keep the interface uncluttered.
