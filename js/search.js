search.js – Implements the search bar’s auto-suggest and quick navigation functionality. This file enables users to find content by typing keywords. Its responsibilities include:
Live suggestions: As the user types into the search input, search.js listens for input or keyup events. It then filters the list of topics/subtopics to find matches. This might be done by scanning the DOM for titles or by searching through a JavaScript data structure representing all topics (which could be defined in navigation.js or separately). The script generates a dropdown list of suggestions below the search bar showing the titles of topics or subtopics that match the query (possibly highlighting the matching term).
Autocomplete UI: It manages the creation and updating of the suggestion list element in the DOM. This includes positioning the suggestion dropdown and making it keyboard-accessible (e.g., allowing arrow keys to navigate suggestions and Enter to select).
Selecting a result: When the user clicks on a suggestion or presses Enter on a highlighted suggestion, search.js handles that action. Depending on what type of item was selected, it will trigger navigation to that item:
If the selected item is a top-level category or intermediate subtopic (one that normally just expands), the script can call a function in navigation.js to expand that category/subtopic so the user can then see its contents. It may also highlight it if appropriate.
If the selected item is a final subtopic (a leaf node), the script can directly invoke the logic to display its detail section (essentially simulating a click on that item). This likely calls a navigation.js function (or uses a shared mechanism) to open the detail view for that topic.

/*
Integration with history: After navigating to the chosen item, search.js may inform history.js of the navigation event (or, if navigation.js already handles pushing to history when it opens a detail, search.js can rely on that). This ensures that using search to find something still records the action in the history stack and persistent history.
No result handling: If no topics match the query, the script might handle this by showing a “No results” message or simply having an empty suggestion list. It also likely clears the suggestions when the input is cleared or when the user clicks outside the search box.
Performance considerations: For a fast user experience, search.js might pre-index the topic titles (e.g., create an array of all topic/subtopic names at startup) so that suggestions appear instantly as the user types. Since no external libraries are used, all of this is custom code.
