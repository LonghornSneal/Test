/*
  medications.js â€“ Contains ALS medication reference data and dosage calculation tools.
  
  Responsibilities:
  1. Define a global data structure (e.g., an array of medication objects) containing critical information for each medication:
     - name: the name of the medication.
     - doses: an object with adult and pediatric dosage guidelines (as human-readable strings, possibly with dosage per weight for pediatric).
     - contraindications: an array of strings listing contraindications for that medication.
     - notes: any additional important notes or usage guidelines.
  2. Provide helper functions related to medication data, such as calculateDose(), which uses the current patient information to give a recommended dose.
     - calculateDose(medName, patient): returns a string recommendation based on patientData (for example, if pediatric, might calculate per kg dose).
     - Ensure this function is global so other files (patientData.js, navigation.js) can call it.
  3. Keep data and logic separate from UI: this file does not manipulate the DOM or handle events; it simply provides data and pure functions.
  4. Use placeholders or example values for demonstration. Additional medications can be added following the same structure.
  5. No modules: everything here is in the global scope by inclusion in index.html.
  
  Note: The dosage calculation provided is basic (checks if patient is pediatric by age or weight threshold). 
  In a more advanced app, this could be extended to perform actual dose calculations (e.g., weight-based calculation) if more detailed data (like mg per kg) were available.
