# New App Planning Repository

This repository captures the early planning artifacts for our next application. The runtime codebase does not live here yet—only high-level documentation that explains the product vision and the steps required to deliver the first release.

## Project Vision
- Provide a focused problem statement and success criteria for the new product.
- Maintain a single source of truth for the app's scope, user experience goals, and technical constraints.
- Track outstanding decisions and assumptions so the implementation team can validate them before writing code.

## Repository Contents
- `README.md` – high-level overview of the product goals and documentation index.
- `ROADMAP.md` – milestone-based plan outlining the work required to reach launch readiness.

## How to Use These Docs
1. Review the roadmap to understand upcoming milestones and responsibilities.
2. Update both documents whenever priorities shift or new research emerges.
3. Treat this repository as the canonical planning artifact until the implementation repository is established.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the product brief with stakeholders.
- Translate roadmap milestones into detailed engineering tickets once the delivery repo is provisioned.
- Archive or supersede these documents after the working codebase is in place.
