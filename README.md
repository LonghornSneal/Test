test repo for the Paramedic Quick Reference repo. The Paramedic Quick Reference is a single-page web application that offers paramedics a quick-access guide to critical information. It includes hierarchical categories of topics (like protocols, medications, etc.), detailed medication information for ALS (Advanced Life Support) drugs, a patient info sidebar for contextual inputs, and dynamic features such as dosage calculations and warnings based on patient data. How about any that might be useful for incorporating into my Paramedic app that I am creating. My Paramedic app will have the following things coded for it. A main contents page that has a list of topics. A blue arrow (pointing towards the right) adjacent to the topic. When either the blue arrow (pointing to the right) or the topic title that is adjacent to this blue arrow is clicked upon, the blue arrow rotates to face downward and expands a list of subtopics. The subtopics will also have a blue arrow adjacent to itself if there are more subtopics within that subtopic. The subtopics without a blue arrow will be a clickable button that when clicked upon will open up a focused section dedicated to that specific subtopic. This dedicated section can contain: links, images, videos, hidden text that can be expanded (and collapsed after expanding) when the text that is hiding it is clicked upon, a expandible list of topics. The main contents page will have a title at the top center and a search bar underneath it. The search bar will begin populating with related options when the user begins typing in it. In the top left of the main contents page there will be a expandible button that brings up a section with different topics that the user can enter data into. This data that is entered in by the user will be able to have the following effects on the rest of the app: strikethrough text that is no longer appropriate, warnings, narrowed lists, focused lists, formulas will now have their calculations already performed with math to obtain to calculations visible to the user, new button options, faded topic buttons, the user entered data will have the most important data shown on the screen as the user navigates through the app afterwards, and this area will automatically collapse when the user clicks outside of this boxed in section. At all times in the top right of the app there will be a back navigation button, a forward navigation button, and a button underneath that takes the user to the home screen. When the user clicks the back navigation button, the user will be taken back to the prior screen with the last thing the user had clicked upon now being highlighted. The forward navigation button can only be used after the back navigation button has been used. Font will incorporate all the various style options. When the user exits the app and goes back into the app, the user will be able to easily access any information that the user had previously inputted into the app and there will be a history button that is on the screen at all times that will give a scrollable list, that starts from the most recent button that the user had clicked upon in the app session or in prior app sections, and this button can be clicked upon with the button having the full functionality of the button it represents. The code will be organized into separate files and folders, so information that is in one file may have to be accessed by one or more files. The code will incorporate only html, css, and javascript. Modules will not be used.
