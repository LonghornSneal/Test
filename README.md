# CosmoBond

CosmoBond is an interactive Samsung Galaxy Watch8 Classic watch face that pairs timekeeping with caring for evolving anime-style companions. Wearers choose one of three starters—Nebula Pangolin, Glyph Dragonet, or Rhythm Lynx—and nurture them through activity milestones, language mini-games, or music-driven dance sessions. Each pet’s mood and growth surface directly on the watch face with expressive animations, optional cosmetic overlays when other apps are foregrounded, and story arcs that unfold over time.

Key pillars:
- **Personalized evolution:** Goal-driven growth adapts to each wearer’s priorities, from improving sleep consistency to mastering rhythm challenges.
- **Ambient companionship:** Pets stay glanceable without nagging prompts, respecting Do Not Disturb while conveying needs through animation and overlays.
- **Social play:** Bluetooth co-op, invite circles, public events, and QR-triggered meetups let pets collaborate, prank, or relocate when neglected.
- **Offline-first design:** Care progress, audio-reactive behaviors, and customization settings work without a phone connection, syncing only when available.
