# New App Planning Repository

This repository captures the early planning artifacts for our next application. The runtime codebase does not live here yet—only high-level documentation that explains the product vision. The steps required to deliver the first release is in ROADMAP.md. AI agents will use the ROADMAP.md file to build the app one task at a time, and by checking off completed tasks as the app is being produced.

## Project Vision
- Provide a focused problem statement and success criteria for the new product.
- Maintain a single source of truth for the app's scope, user experience goals, and technical constraints.
- Track outstanding decisions and assumptions so the implementation team can validate them before writing code.

## Repository Contents
- `README.md` – high-level overview of the product goals, discovery status, and planning checkpoints.

## How to Use These Docs
1. Review this README to understand current goals and outstanding questions.
