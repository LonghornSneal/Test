# CosmoBond BeatBunny Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion tuned for rhythm-synced lighting, neon stage props, and exaggerated dance poses.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, nightclub obsidian (#040206) background, and follow-cam framing to accent kicks.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, tighten sync to BPM in After Effects, and produce GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Anthropomorphic rabbit with elongated ears shaped like headphones, glossy lavender fur, and LED stripe markings down its limbs.
- Face: big confident grin, luminous eyes with waveform pupils, and a tiny nose ring.
- Accessories: hovering DJ turntable, equalizer pillars, and floating tempo numerals.
- Occupies central space with stage floor underneath.

## Interaction Map
- **Beat Drop:** Triggered when music playback starts or tempo increases, featuring high-energy dance loops.
- **Tempo Change:** Fires when user switches genres or BPM, showing transitional choreography.
