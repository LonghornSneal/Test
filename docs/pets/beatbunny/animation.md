# BeatBunny

Pet visual description: Anthropomorphic rabbit with elongated ears shaped like headphones, glossy lavender fur, and LED stripe markings down its limbs. Face: big confident grin, luminous eyes with waveform pupils, and a tiny nose ring. Accessories: hovering DJ turntable, equalizer pillars, and floating tempo numerals. Occupies central space with stage floor underneath.

Animation: Ambient Bounce
Animation description: BeatBunny stands relaxed, ears bobbing to a faint beat. LED stripes pulse soft purple. Turntable spins slowly behind. Equalizer pillars glow low. Tail taps rhythmically. Bunny shifts weight side to side, shoulders rolling. It snaps fingers, sending small light pulses. Ears wiggle, tracing subtle arcs. It nods once, ready for the next bounce.

Animation: Voltage Pop
Animation description: Fur glows neon; LED stripes intensify. Ears flare like headphone arms emitting sparks. Turntable ejects energy waves. Stage floor lights chase under the feet. Body launches into explosive moves. BeatBunny crouches deeply, storing energy. It rockets upward into a split jump, ears forming arcs of light. Mid-air, it spins, flinging neon droplets outward. Landing, it hits a power pose as equalizer pillars spike.

Animation: Slide Switch
Animation description: Colors flicker between cool blues and warm oranges. Turntable morphs into a slider board. Bunny's ears flatten back like aerodynamic fins. LED stripes strobe alternating patterns. Tail sweeps like a metronome. BeatBunny slides sideways, dragging the slider board. It spins on one heel, snapping to the new tempo color. The bunny taps its ear, syncing to the new beat. It resumes a smooth groove matching the adjusted BPM.

Animation: Silence Pause
Animation description: Fur desaturates; LEDs dim. Turntable stops; equalizer pillars flicker. Ears droop, forming a sad curve. Body slumps on the stage steps. Tail lies still. BeatBunny sits, hugging knees. It taps the turntable, but no sound plays. The bunny sighs, ears falling further. A faint beat tries to start but fades, resetting the pause.

Animation: Club Carousel
Animation description: Stage floods with rainbow lights; fur sparkles. Ears spin like propellers, tossing glitter. Turntable lifts, orbiting the bunny. Equalizer pillars animate like carousel poles. Tail forms a neon ribbon. BeatBunny leaps onto the hovering turntable. It rides the spinning platform, striking poses to the beat. Glitter rains as the bunny flips backward gracefully. It lands, blowing a kiss toward the camera before repeating.

Animation: Fading Stage
Animation description: Stage lights dim rapidly; background cracks. Bunny becomes a silhouette outlined by faint LEDs. Turntable disassembles into static. Tail leaves a fading waveform. Eyes look back sadly. BeatBunny steps off the stage, ears trailing light. It walks toward the darkness as spotlights shut off. The silhouette dissolves into pixels. Only a flickering equalizer remains before reset.

Animation: Vinyl Memorial
Animation description: Bunny freezes into a holographic statue atop a vinyl record. Ears form a protective arc; LEDs turn to engraved grooves. Turntable transforms into a pedestal. Soft teal light glows beneath the record. Floating musical notes drift slowly. BeatBunny exudes one final beat that ripples across the record. Body crystallizes into hologram shards. Record spins once, emitting a gentle chord. Light fades, leaving the silent memorial before the loop rewinds.
