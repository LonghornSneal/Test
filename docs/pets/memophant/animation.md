# Memophant

Pet visual description: Mini elephant with pastel lavender skin, oversized ears shaped like sticky notes, and trunk tipped with a fountain-pen nib. Palette: lavender body, mint inner ears, and copper tusk caps; cheeks blush peach. Face: wide thoughtful eyes, gentle smile, and freckles across the forehead. Accessories: messenger satchel overflowing with cards, floating checklists, and a tiny desk lamp hovering overhead. Positioned at the lower center, trunk extending toward the complication strip.

Animation: Desk Hover
Animation description: Memophant sits on a floating clipboard; satchel rests beside. Ears gently flap, resembling post-it corners. Desk lamp casts warm glow cycles. Floating checklists flip slowly. Trunk idly traces loops in the air. Elephant inhales, ears flaring slightly. It taps the clipboard with the pen-tip trunk, producing a tiny ink dot. Satchel strap shifts as the pet adjusts posture. Ears settle back, repeating the calm hover.

Animation: Ink Trail
Animation description: Colors brighten; eyes focused. Trunk extends like a fountain pen, glowing teal. Floating cards align in front of the pet. Lamp intensifies, spotlighting the writing area. Ears fold forward to mimic paper tabs. Memophant unfurls the trunk, writing cursive on a card. Ink trail sparkles, forming icons representing the memo. It stamps the card with a copper tusk seal. Card floats into the satchel, resetting the stack.

Animation: Card Confetti
Animation description: Palette shifts to pastel rainbow; eyes joyful. Satchel pops open, releasing miniature checkmarks. Trunk curls into a party horn shape. Ears flutter rapidly. Desk lamp spins, casting dancing light beams. Memophant blows through its trunk, shooting checkmark confetti. It tosses cards into the air with both ears. The elephant catches a card on its trunk, twirls, and bows. Cards settle back neatly as it prepares to celebrate again.

Animation: Overdue Burdened
Animation description: Colors dull to grayish lavender; eyes droop. Satchel bulges, spilling overdue slips. Desk lamp flickers weakly. Trunk drags along the clipboard, leaving messy ink smears. Ears droop heavily. Memophant struggles to lift the satchel, wobbling. It sighs, trunk smearing ink accidentally. Cards fall everywhere; the elephant scrambles to pick them up. Exhausted, it slumps, only to repeat the frazzled attempt.

Animation: Archive Glow
Animation description: Skin glows softly; ears shimmer mint. Satchel emits a golden aura; cards stack perfectly. Desk lamp becomes a radiant lantern. Floating badges show "Done" stamps. Trunk spins a pen flourish. Memophant raises a stack of completed cards, hugging them proudly. It releases the cards, which orbit like planets. The elephant performs a graceful trunk flourish, leaving light trails. Cards reassemble into a neat archive box before the loop restarts.

Animation: Paper Trail
Animation description: Body becomes semi-transparent; ink lines sketch its outline. Cards cascade downward forming a path leading off-screen. Satchel slips from the shoulder, scattering notes. Lamp dims to a distant glow. Eyes look back sadly. Memophant drops a bundle of cards that flow like a river. It steps onto the paper trail, trunk waving goodbye. The satchel slides off, landing near the viewer. Elephant fades into the distance as papers swirl, then reset.

Animation: Memory Capsule
Animation description: Elephant curls around a glowing capsule filled with preserved cards. Body takes on a porcelain finish with gold cracks (kintsugi style). Ears fold gently over the capsule; eyes closed peacefully. Desk lamp morphs into a candle emitting steady light. Floating text reads "Remember". Memophant exhales, sealing the capsule with a soft light ribbon. Gold cracks shimmer as the porcelain body stabilizes. Candle flame flickers once, casting long shadows. Scene holds quietly before rewinding to the sealing breath.
