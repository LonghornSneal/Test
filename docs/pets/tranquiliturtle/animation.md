Animation description: TranquiliTurtle floats on a lotus cushion; shell glows softly. Incense orb releases slow spirals. Prayer beads orbit wrists. Eyes half-closed; smile relaxed. Background ripples gently. Turtle inhales, shell expanding subtly. Cushion sinks slightly, releasing ripples. Exhale sends glitter particles upward. Turtle tilts head, returning to neutral.

Animation: Lotus Hover
Animation description: Shell emits bright jade aura; fins fold into lotus mudras. Eyes close fully; beads align above the shell. Cushion levitates higher. Breathing ring displays inhale/hold/exhale cues. Background darkens to spotlight the turtle. Turtle raises into mid-air, legs crossing in meditation. It inhales, breathing ring expanding outward. A hold moment glows golden around the shell. Exhale lowers the turtle gently before looping.

Animation: Aura Sweep
Animation description: Shell glows turquoise; fins extend outward. Eyes open softly, offering encouragement. Breathing meter forms arcs along the shell edges. Incense orb pulses faster. Background ripples accelerate. Turtle extends fins, tracing a glowing arc labeled "Breathe In". It brings fins inward at the hold cue, shell pulsing. Exhale arcs sweep outward, clearing stress icons. Turtle smiles gently as the arcs fade.

Animation: Stress Warning
Animation description: Colors dull; shell closes partially. Eyes open with worry; incense flickers erratically. Beads tangle. Cushion droops, nearly touching water. Background ripples become jagged. Turtle trembles, clutching beads. It breathes rapidly, shell shuddering. Incense orb flickers red, casting sharp shadows. Turtle curls into the shell before repeating.

Animation: Lotus Bloom
Animation description: Shell blossoms into translucent lotus petals. Eyes sparkle; smile wide. Cushion erupts with luminous flowers. Beads release glitter. Background filled with aurora waves. Turtle spins slowly, petals opening around it. It releases a joyful laugh, scattering petals outward. Turtle bows, pressing fins together in gratitude. Petals reassemble under the shell before the next spin.

Animation: Retreat Dive
Animation description: Body becomes semi-transparent water; shell darkens. Incense orb extinguishes. Cushion dissolves into mist. Eyes glance back sadly. Background forms a whirlpool doorway. Turtle looks back once, beads falling away. It dives into the whirlpool, body dissolving into water trails. Shell disappears beneath the surface. Whirlpool closes, leaving lingering ripples.

Animation: Still Pond
Animation description: TranquiliTurtle rests beneath translucent water; shell becomes stone. Lotus cushion unfurls into floating petals around the body. Beads wrap the shell gently; eyes closed. Incense orb transforms into a candle flame. Pond surface mirrors the moon. Water calms, revealing the resting turtle. Candle flame flickers once, illuminating the shell. Petals drift outward in slow circles. Moon reflection fades before the loop restarts.
