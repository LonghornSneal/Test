# CosmoBond RoverFox Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion emphasizing cinematic parallax and travel ephemera.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, parchment charcoal (#0A0907) background, and diagonal camera framing to highlight movement toward the horizon.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, brush in postcard textures via Photoshop, and export GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets for integration.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Adventurous fox with a lean build, oversized ears tipped in copper, and a tufted tail painted like a compass needle.
- Fur palette: rust orange, cream muzzle, charcoal socks, and teal backpack straps.
- Face: bright amber eyes with freckles, confident grin, and a tiny scar across one eyebrow; style inspired by watercolor storybooks.
- Accessories: canvas explorer backpack, enamel pins of visited locales, and a hovering holographic map ribbon.
- Occupies mid-right of the dial while tail frames the date complication.

## Interaction Map
- **Explore Stride:** Triggered when motion-gated GPS logs a new location, showing confident trekking.
- **Souvenir Share:** Fires when the user marks a location as favorite or accepts a postcard prompt, highlighting trinket display.
