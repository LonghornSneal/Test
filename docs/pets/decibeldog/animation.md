# CosmoBond DecibelDog Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion emphasizing expressive canine body language with comic-style linework.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, charcoal soundstage (#060607) background, and slightly low camera angle so ear sweeps stay within frame.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, amplify neon equalizer streaks in After Effects, and publish GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Playful beagle-like pup with oversized ears that resemble audio waveguides and a stubby tail that ends in a music note.
- Fur palette: warm tan base with cream muzzle, black back patches, and cyan LED strips tracing the ears.
- Face: big round eyes with sparkle pupils, soft nose, and a lopsided grin; art style blends Saturday-morning cartoon with vector shading.
- Accessories: collar shaped like a volume knob, headphone charms on each ear, and floating decibel meters.
- Size: seated at lower-left quadrant, leaving room for complications while tail sweeps along the bottom edge.

## Interaction Map
- **Conversation Perk:** Triggered when the user speaks to the watch or uses voice replies, highlighting attentive listening motions.
- **Music Dance:** Activated when media playback or beat detection fires, showcasing rhythmic pawwork and light effects.
