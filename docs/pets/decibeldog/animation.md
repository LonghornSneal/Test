# DecibelDog

Pet visual description: Playful beagle-like pup with oversized ears that resemble audio waveguides and a stubby tail that ends in a music note. Fur palette: warm tan base with cream muzzle, black back patches, and cyan LED strips tracing the ears. Face: big round eyes with sparkle pupils, soft nose, and a lopsided grin; art style blends Saturday-morning cartoon with vector shading. Accessories: collar shaped like a volume knob, headphone charms on each ear, and floating decibel meters. Size: seated at lower-left quadrant, leaving room for complications while tail sweeps along the bottom edge.

Animation: Quiet Ear Drift
Animation description: Tan fur rendered with soft gradients; LED strips glow faint cyan pulses. Eyes half-closed, ears gently swaying inward, tail tapping a soft beat. Collar volume knob set to a calm mid-level; decibel meters float with low bars. Pup rests on a round cushion patterned with waveform doodles. Background features faint studio panels and dust motes. DecibelDog inhales, ears lifting slightly as the LED strips brighten. It exhales with a content sigh, ears drooping back down while the cushion sinks a little. Tail makes a lazy wag arc, drawing a translucent eighth note across the floor. The pup closes its eyes fully for a moment, then reopens them to repeat the drift.

Animation: Listener Tilt
Animation description: Fur remains tan but LED strips flash alternating cyan and amber pulses. Eyes widen with focused pupils; mouth forms an eager smile. Ears angle sharply toward the viewer, acting like parabolic dishes. Floating speech bubble icons hover nearby with animated waveforms. Tail is upright, wagging in short bursts. DecibelDog tilts its head left, ear fully extended as a speech bubble appears. It leans closer, one paw lifted, and the LED strips pulse in sync with the waveform. The pup perks up, ears flaring outward, and releases a tiny bark indicated by a musical note. It resets to center, tail wagging quickly, ready for the next bubble.

Animation: Beat Bounce
Animation description: Fur edges glow magenta and teal; LED strips chase like nightclub lighting. Eyes sparkle with star-shaped highlights; grin wide open. Pup dons translucent visor shades and stands on a glowing equalizer stage. Tail traces sine waves while paws tap neon tiles. Floating speakers pump light beams that pulse with the beat. DecibelDog hops onto hind legs, front paws in the air while the equalizer bars jump. It spins 180 degrees, tail drawing a luminous spiral that wraps around the speakers. The pup moonwalks backward, ears acting as bouncing VU meters. It finishes with a paw-slide pose, visor flickering, before looping back to the hop.

Animation: Noise Overload Flinch
Animation description: Colors desaturate; LED strips flicker red warnings. Eyes squint shut, brows furrowed; ears press tightly against the head. Collar volume knob spins uncontrollably; decibel meter spikes scarlet. Pup crouches low with paws covering ears. Background bursts with jagged red zigzags. DecibelDog flinches, shrinking into itself as a red spike shoots up behind it. It winces, paws pressing harder over ears, LED strips glitching. The pup peeks out sadly, then recoils as another spike appears. It curls tighter, trembling, before repeating the overload reaction.

Animation: Tailwave Chorus
Animation description: Fur regains rich hues; LED strips cycle rainbow. Eyes close joyfully; mouth opens in a melodic howl. Tail grows longer, forming a glowing ribbon with music notes along it. Mini speaker drones orbit, singing backup harmonies. Pup sits upright on hind legs, chest puffed out. DecibelDog howls upward, tail ribbon spiraling to form treble clefs. It sways side to side, drones echoing the melody in synchronized colors. The pup claps paws together, releasing glittering note particles. It leans back with a big smile before inhaling for the next chorus.

Animation: Silent Alley Dash
Animation description: Body turns semi-transparent with motion blur streaks; LED strips dim to single lines. Eyes glance back sadly; ears fold tight to reduce drag. Cushion dissolves into cobblestone alley textures. Collapsing sound panels form a narrowing tunnel ahead. Tail leaves a fading waveform trailing behind. DecibelDog looks back at the viewer, ears trembling. It bolts down the alley, paws barely touching the ground as the waveform trail flickers. Panels crash behind, forcing the pup to sprint faster toward a dark exit. The dog leaps into the darkness, waveform snapping shut before the loop restarts.

Animation: Echo Fade Vigil
Animation description: Fur turns monochrome with faint cyan outlines; LED strips freeze as a single dot. Eyes close peacefully; ears rest flat. Collar volume knob stops at zero, projecting a quiet halo. Pup lies on the waveform cushion, tail wrapped around paws. Floating candles shaped like microphones hover around, flickering softly. DecibelDog exhales, breath forming a visible soundwave that dissipates quickly. The microphone candles ignite one by one, casting gentle reflections on the fur. The halo from the collar pulses once, illuminating the closed eyes. The scene fades to grayscale, then rewinds to the first exhale for the memorial loop.
