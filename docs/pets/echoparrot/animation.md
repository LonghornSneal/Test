# CosmoBond EchoParrot Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion focusing on vibrant plumage motion and waveform-driven glow effects.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, midnight teal (#03121A) background, and dynamic camera with slight parallax to emphasize beak gestures.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, adjust luminescence trails in After Effects, and publish GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Neon parrot with iridescent feathers transitioning from cyan to magenta, sleek holographic crest, and microphone-shaped tail.
- Face: large expressive eyes, curved beak with metallic sheen, and cheek lights that pulse with audio.
- Accessories: floating speech bubbles, wearable voice badge, and looping waveform arc behind the bird.
- Size: perched on a glowing mic stand centered along the lower third of the dial.

## Interaction Map
- **Voice Listen:** Triggered when the user activates voice commands or dictation, highlighting attentive mimic posture.
- **Command Echo:** Fires when the assistant responds or repeats a phrase, showcasing mimicry and waveform bursts.

## Animation States

### Idle State — "Perch Hum"
- **Title:** Perch Hum
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - EchoParrot perches calmly; feathers shimmer softly.
  - Crest pulses gently; cheek lights emit faint glow.

- **Action Sequence:**
  1. EchoParrot tilts head sharply left, crest pointing to the viewer.
  2. It leans closer, eyes sparkling, while the waveform line tightens.
  3. The bird nods twice, recording the sound.
  4. It re-centers, waiting for the next command.

### Interaction State — Command Echo "Neon Reply"
- **Title:** Neon Reply
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Feathers flare neon magenta and cyan; crest spikes upward.
  - Beak opens wide, projecting holographic text.
  - Waveform arc explodes into concentric circles.
  - Tail microphone glows white-hot.
  - Speech bubbles display mirrored phrases.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. EchoParrot inhales, chest expanding as lights gather.
  2. It projects the phrase, beak emitting animated text.
  3. Wings extend, scattering glowing syllables.
  4. Bird bows slightly, satisfied, before repeating.

### Sick State — "Silence Wait"
- **Title:** Silence Wait
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Feathers desaturate; crest droops.
  - Eyes half-closed; beak sealed.
  - Waveform arc flatlines; speech bubbles fade.
  - Tail microphone flickers.
  - Body slumps on the stand.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. EchoParrot sags, crest hanging limp.
  2. It coughs quietly, causing static to pop from cheek lights.
  3. The bird looks at the viewer apologetically.
  4. It shivers, feathers rustling before returning to slump.

### Happy State — "Chorus Spiral"
- **Title:** Chorus Spiral
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Feathers shimmer iridescent; crest forms a spiral.
  - Eyes sparkle; beak open in laughter.
  - Waveform arc becomes a rainbow helix.
  - Tail microphone spins, leaving light trails.
  - Floating music notes orbit the parrot.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. EchoParrot spirals upward off the perch, scattering note particles.
  2. It loops around the waveform helix, singing joyfully.
  3. The bird perches mid-air, wings outstretched, then swoops back down.
  4. It lands with a triumphant chirp, ready to spiral again.

### Runaway State — "Signal Fade"
- **Title:** Signal Fade
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body becomes translucent static; crest fragments into data shards.
  - Waveform arc collapses into a narrow beam leading to a dark portal.
  - Tail microphone detaches, floating after the bird.
  - Eyes dim sadly.
  - Speech bubbles crack with glitches.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. EchoParrot looks back, crest shedding shards.
  2. It flies toward the portal, trailing static feathers.
  3. The microphone tail follows, leaving a dotted line.
  4. Portal snaps shut, scattering residual pixels before loop resets.

### Death State — "Echo Fossil"
- **Title:** Echo Fossil
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Parrot becomes a translucent glass sculpture embedded within the mic stand.
  - Crest frozen mid-wave; eyes closed peacefully.
  - Waveform arc converts to etched glass behind the body.
  - Tail microphone rests at the base, now inert crystal.
  - Soft cyan light glows within.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Glass sculpture pulses once with cyan light.
  2. Embedded waveform flickers, replaying a final tiny chirp.
  3. Light fades gradually, leaving the sculpture serene.
  4. A faint echo ripple travels outward before the loop restarts.
