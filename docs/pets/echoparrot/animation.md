# EchoParrot

Pet visual description: Neon parrot with iridescent feathers transitioning from cyan to magenta, sleek holographic crest, and microphone-shaped tail. Face: large expressive eyes, curved beak with metallic sheen, and cheek lights that pulse with audio. Accessories: floating speech bubbles, wearable voice badge, and looping waveform arc behind the bird. Size: perched on a glowing mic stand centered along the lower third of the dial.

Animation: Perch Hum
Animation description: EchoParrot perches calmly; feathers shimmer softly. Crest pulses gently; cheek lights emit faint glow. Waveform arc drifts lazily behind. Tail microphone sways. Eyes blink with relaxed eyelids. Parrot rocks side to side, shifting weight on the stand. It hums, beak barely opening while cheek lights glow. Crest flicks upward, sending small notes upward. Bird returns to neutral stance, repeating the hum.

Animation: Focus Tilt
Animation description: Feathers brighten; crest leans toward the user. Eyes widen; beak opens slightly. Waveform arc compresses into a thin listening line. Tail microphone points forward like an antenna. Floating speech bubbles appear with ellipses. EchoParrot tilts head sharply left, crest pointing to the viewer. It leans closer, eyes sparkling, while the waveform line tightens. The bird nods twice, recording the sound. It re-centers, waiting for the next command.

Animation: Neon Reply
Animation description: Feathers flare neon magenta and cyan; crest spikes upward. Beak opens wide, projecting holographic text. Waveform arc explodes into concentric circles. Tail microphone glows white-hot. Speech bubbles display mirrored phrases. EchoParrot inhales, chest expanding as lights gather. It projects the phrase, beak emitting animated text. Wings extend, scattering glowing syllables. Bird bows slightly, satisfied, before repeating.

Animation: Silence Wait
Animation description: Feathers desaturate; crest droops. Eyes half-closed; beak sealed. Waveform arc flatlines; speech bubbles fade. Tail microphone flickers. Body slumps on the stand. EchoParrot sags, crest hanging limp. It coughs quietly, causing static to pop from cheek lights. The bird looks at the viewer apologetically. It shivers, feathers rustling before returning to slump.

Animation: Chorus Spiral
Animation description: Feathers shimmer iridescent; crest forms a spiral. Eyes sparkle; beak open in laughter. Waveform arc becomes a rainbow helix. Tail microphone spins, leaving light trails. Floating music notes orbit the parrot. EchoParrot spirals upward off the perch, scattering note particles. It loops around the waveform helix, singing joyfully. The bird perches mid-air, wings outstretched, then swoops back down. It lands with a triumphant chirp, ready to spiral again.

Animation: Signal Fade
Animation description: Body becomes translucent static; crest fragments into data shards. Waveform arc collapses into a narrow beam leading to a dark portal. Tail microphone detaches, floating after the bird. Eyes dim sadly. Speech bubbles crack with glitches. EchoParrot looks back, crest shedding shards. It flies toward the portal, trailing static feathers. The microphone tail follows, leaving a dotted line. Portal snaps shut, scattering residual pixels before loop resets.

Animation: Echo Fossil
Animation description: Parrot becomes a translucent glass sculpture embedded within the mic stand. Crest frozen mid-wave; eyes closed peacefully. Waveform arc converts to etched glass behind the body. Tail microphone rests at the base, now inert crystal. Soft cyan light glows within. Glass sculpture pulses once with cyan light. Embedded waveform flickers, replaying a final tiny chirp. Light fades gradually, leaving the sculpture serene. A faint echo ripple travels outward before the loop restarts.
