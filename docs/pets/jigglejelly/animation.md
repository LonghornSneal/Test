# CosmoBond JiggleJelly Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion tuned for squishy secondary motion and playful color shifts.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, deep midnight (#05040A) background, and overhead camera to capture bounces without clipping.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, polish specular highlights in Blender grease pencil pass, and publish GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Gelatinous creature shaped like a rounded cube with translucent layers, suspended sprinkling candies, and expressive eyes floating within the gel.
- Palette cycles between bubblegum pinks, citrus oranges, and aqua blues; edges outlined with white ink strokes.
- Facial features: floating oval eyes, tiny cat-like mouth, and eyebrows formed by suspended glitter.
- Accessories: mini spring shoes, party streamer scarf, and a hovering motion sensor orb.
- Occupies center of dial, stretching upward with each bounce while feet remain within lower safe zone.

## Interaction Map
- **Playful Bounce Mini-Game:** Triggered when the user shakes or taps the watch, emphasizing exaggerated squash-and-stretch.
- **Motion Stretch Routine:** Activated when the user completes a guided stretch reminder, showcasing elongated jelly poses.
