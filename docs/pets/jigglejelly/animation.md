# JiggleJelly

Pet visual description: Gelatinous creature shaped like a rounded cube with translucent layers, suspended sprinkling candies, and expressive eyes floating within the gel. Palette cycles between bubblegum pinks, citrus oranges, and aqua blues; edges outlined with white ink strokes. Facial features: floating oval eyes, tiny cat-like mouth, and eyebrows formed by suspended glitter. Accessories: mini spring shoes, party streamer scarf, and a hovering motion sensor orb. Occupies center of dial, stretching upward with each bounce while feet remain within lower safe zone.

Animation: Ambient Wobble
Animation description: Jelly body gently oscillates, layers shifting between pink and aqua. Eyes drift slowly within the gel, smiling mouth centered. Motion orb hovers overhead, emitting faint pulsing dots. Spring shoes compress slightly; streamer scarf floats. Background sparkles with subtle confetti specks. JiggleJelly sinks slightly, sides bulging outward. It rebounds, stretching vertically as eyes drift upward. A soft ripple travels across the body, scattering glitter. The gel settles, ready for the next wobble.

Animation: Gumball Hop
Animation description: Colors intensify to neon pink and orange; eyes widen. Spring shoes glow with pastel lightning; scarf twirls. Motion orb projects tap targets shaped like gumballs. Jelly body elongates with each leap, trailing candy particles. Background adds arcade gridlines. JiggleJelly squashes flat as tap targets appear. It springs upward, grabbing a gumball with a tiny suction pop. Mid-air, the jelly twists, flinging candy confetti outward. It lands with a cheerful bounce, resetting for the next tap cue.

Animation: Rainbow Reach
Animation description: Palette transitions through a rainbow gradient from base to top. Eyes close peacefully; mouth forms a concentrated pout. Scarf aligns into a straight ribbon pointing upward. Motion orb displays stretch timer rings. Body elongates like taffy, revealing layered translucency. JiggleJelly anchors its shoes, rising slowly as layers slide upward. It reaches maximum height, forming a thin column with sparkles raining down. The jelly exhales, shrinking back while timer rings contract. It jiggles once to reset before repeating the stretch.

Animation: Neglected Still
Animation description: Colors fade to pale pastel, edges droop. Eyes sink, half-lidded; mouth frowns. Streamer scarf falls limp; motion orb flickers. Air bubbles stagnate within the gel. Body barely moves, flattening slightly. JiggleJelly sags, corners touching the ground. A sad bubble escapes, bursting weakly above. The eyes blink slowly, releasing a tiny tear droplet. It remains flat for a beat before looping the slump.

Animation: Confetti Cascade
Animation description: Jelly glows like stained glass with rainbow veins. Eyes sparkle with star highlights; mouth beams. Streamer scarf becomes a whirlpool; motion orb spins rapidly. Mini party horns sprout from the gel surface. Body spins while bouncing. JiggleJelly spins, releasing confetti geysers from its crown. It splits momentarily into three smaller blobs that orbit. The blobs merge back with a satisfying plop, sending ripples outward. It claps its jelly hands, triggering another confetti burst before repeating.

Animation: Portal Splatter
Animation description: Body stretches into a comet streak, leaving neon slime trails. Eyes wide with apology; mouth forms an "o". Motion orb tears open a portal shaped like a paint splash. Streamer scarf frays into ribbons. Background darkens with fast-moving streaks. JiggleJelly compresses, then rockets toward the splash portal. It collides, splattering across the portal rim. The gel funnels through, leaving drips behind. Remaining droplets wiggle before rewinding to the launch.

Animation: Crystalized Keepsake
Animation description: Jelly solidifies into a translucent crystal statue with suspended confetti frozen mid-air. Eyes close softly; mouth relaxed. Streamer scarf wraps tightly like a ribbon bow. Motion orb dims into a glass marble resting atop the statue. Base becomes a mirrored pedestal. JiggleJelly slowly hardens, colors shifting to pastel glass. Confetti freezes, sparkling as light passes through. The marble glows once, casting rays across the pedestal. Light fades, leaving the crystal still before the loop restarts.
