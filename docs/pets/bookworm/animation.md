# CosmoBond BookWorm Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion configured for 4-second loops with storybook lighting and macro depth-of-field.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 8-bit color, deep navy background (#05060C), and steady camera angled down toward the tome.
- **Post-processing:** Convert MP4 masters to 60 fps PNG stacks, refine glow edges on glyphs in Photoshop, and assemble GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Plump caterpillar-butterfly hybrid with five rounded segments painted in mint-to-emerald gradients, lined with crisp cel shading.
- Face: oversized almond eyes with golden irises, rosy cheeks, and a gentle smile showing two nubs.
- Accessories: copper bookmark charm, leather messenger satchel, and glowing firefly companion.
- Rests atop an ornate mahogany book whose pages emit soft teal glyphs.

## Interaction Map
- **Reading Glow:** Triggered when the user logs reading time or starts an in-app session, focusing on page-turn motions.
- **Knowledge Share:** Fires when the user posts a fact or shares progress, highlighting gifting gestures.
