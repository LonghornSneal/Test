# BookWorm

Pet visual description: Plump caterpillar-butterfly hybrid with five rounded segments painted in mint-to-emerald gradients, lined with crisp cel shading. Face: oversized almond eyes with golden irises, rosy cheeks, and a gentle smile showing two nubs. Accessories: copper bookmark charm, leather messenger satchel, and glowing firefly companion. Rests atop an ornate mahogany book whose pages emit soft teal glyphs.

Animation: Luminous Leaf Hover
Animation description: BookWorm lounges atop the open book, segments glowing subtly. Antennae sway with amber droplets; satchel rests at the side. Firefly circles slowly, casting dappled highlights. Copper bookmark dangles from the page edge. Background fades into deep navy with faint bokeh. Caterpillar lowers its front segments, eyes narrowing in focus. It inhales, body lifting slightly while glyphs brighten. Tail curls upward, tapping the bookmark charm. BookWorm exhales, returning to the relaxed hover.

Animation: Page Drift
Animation description: Segments shine brighter mint; eyes widen with curiosity. Front body lifts, nudging the page edge. Firefly hovers near the text, creating spotlights. Bookmark charm emits warm sparks. Satchel strap tightens to keep balance. BookWorm grips the page corner with tiny feet. It rolls the page over, revealing glowing illustrations. Antennae trace the air, leaving light trails along each sentence. Page lands softly as the worm beams proudly.

Animation: Fact Gift
Animation description: Colors shift to pearlescent hues; wings peek from the back. Satchel pops open, revealing scrolls. Firefly perches on the satchel flap. Bookmark charm transforms into a glowing envelope. Eyes sparkle with excitement. BookWorm pulls a scroll from the satchel. It taps the scroll with antennae, turning it into a holographic fact card. The worm bows, presenting the card to the viewer. Card dissolves into glittering words before the loop restarts.

Animation: Stalled Progress
Animation description: Colors fade to muted sage; eyes droop. Firefly light dims; satchel slumps closed. Bookmark charm tarnishes slightly. Body curls inward, hugging the book. Background darkens with drifting dust motes. BookWorm sighs, antennae drooping. It attempts to open a page but lacks strength. The worm shivers, segments collapsing. It rests its head on the closed book before repeating.

Animation: Butterfly Bloom
Animation description: Segments glow neon green; translucent wings unfurl fully. Firefly orbits faster, leaving star trails. Bookmark charm erupts into floating leaves. Satchel spills confetti-like tabs. Eyes sparkle with star-shaped highlights. BookWorm rises on hind segments, wings spreading wide. It twirls above the book, scattering glowing letters. Wings clap gently, creating gusts that flip pages. The worm lands gracefully, giggling before repeating.

Animation: Runaway Departure
Animation description: Body stretches into a trail of green light; wings flutter anxiously. Firefly zips ahead, acting as a guide. Bookmark charm tears into a glowing portal. Satchel tightens for travel. Eyes glance back sadly. BookWorm looks back at the viewer, trembling. It launches toward the bookmark portal, leaving leaf-shaped particles. Wings fold as it squeezes through the glowing slit. Portal snaps shut, scattering loose glyphs before reset.

Animation: Library Cocoon
Animation description: Caterpillar wraps itself in parchment cocoon etched with text. Firefly hovers nearby, acting as vigil candle. Book closes gently beneath the cocoon. Copper charm seals the cocoon with wax. Soft teal light glows within. BookWorm exhales, weaving parchment threads. Cocoon seals, copper charm imprinting a leaf emblem. Firefly circles slowly, casting warm halos. Light fades to a serene glow before the loop resets.
