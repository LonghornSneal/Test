# CosmoBond ZenPanda Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion emphasizing soft painterly lighting with subtle particle bloom suitable for mindfulness motifs.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, dusk charcoal (#080A0D) background, and orthographic camera so lotus props remain centered.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, refine aura gradients in Procreate, and assemble GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Round panda with velvety fur, elongated fingers for mudras, and a floating meditation belt shaped like a halo.
- Palette: inky black patches, pearl white belly, and jade gradients along the paws; cheeks brushed with soft coral blush.
- Face: almond eyes with gentle lashes, small nose, and a kind half-smile; art style inspired by modern wellness illustration.
- Accessories: lotus cushion, mala beads around the wrist, and floating mindfulness glyphs.
- Positioned centrally with cushion anchored to the lower half of the dial, leaving top area free for complications.

## Interaction Map
