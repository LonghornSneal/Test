# ZenPanda

Pet visual description: Round panda with velvety fur, elongated fingers for mudras, and a floating meditation belt shaped like a halo. Palette: inky black patches, pearl white belly, and jade gradients along the paws; cheeks brushed with soft coral blush. Face: almond eyes with gentle lashes, small nose, and a kind half-smile; art style inspired by modern wellness illustration. Accessories: lotus cushion, mala beads around the wrist, and floating mindfulness glyphs. Positioned centrally with cushion anchored to the lower half of the dial, leaving top area free for complications.

Animation: Lotus Drift
Animation description: ZenPanda sits cross-legged on a jade lotus cushion; fur softly lit by teal rim light. Eyes half-closed; smile serene. Halo belt rotates slowly; mala beads dangle with tiny clacks. Background sprinkled with faint bokeh orbs. Hands rest on knees, palms upward. Panda inhales, shoulders rising slightly as the cushion glows brighter. It holds the breath, halo pausing, beads swinging forward. Exhale sends a ripple through the cushion and releases sparkles upward. Panda tilts its head gently before returning to the original posture.

Animation: Prismatic Mudra
Animation description: Fur accented with rainbow reflections; eyes closed fully. Hands form alternating mudras; fingertips glow. Halo expands into layered concentric circles showing inhale/hold/exhale cues. Props: vertical breathing bar and drifting mantra text. Cushion levitates slightly as breaths sync. ZenPanda presses thumbs and index fingers together, halo shifting to "inhale" teal. It opens palms while holding the breath, rainbow glints crossing the fur. Exhale gesture pushes hands outward, releasing gentle pulses toward the viewer. Hands return to lap, halo resets to repeat the cycle.

Animation: Compassion Reach
Animation description: Palette warms to peach and gold; cheeks glow brighter. Eyes open softly with empathetic gaze. Panda extends one paw forward offering a glowing orb. Props: floating affirmation text and gentle heart glyphs. Cushion steadies with subtle vibration lines. ZenPanda lifts the glowing orb, presenting it toward the viewer. It nods slowly, eyes soft, while heart glyphs pulse. The panda presses the orb to its chest, letting warmth spread across the fur. It offers the orb again, smile widening, before looping.

Animation: Stress Alert Slouch
Animation description: Fur desaturates; eyes droop with dark circles. Halo flickers, shrinking to an uneven ellipse. Mala beads tangle; cushion deflates slightly. Props: jagged stress waveform hovering overhead. Body leans forward, paws clutching the cushion. Panda clutches its head, stress waveform spiking. It exhales shakily, halo dimming. Shoulders sag as the cushion depresses further. The waveform fades briefly before spiking again, restarting the slump.

Animation: Radiant Aura Bloom
Animation description: Fur sparkles with golden flecks; eyes bright. Halo expands into lotus petals; mala beads spin gracefully. Cushion emits layered mandalas. Props: butterflies of light and rising incense trails. Panda raises hands overhead in gratitude. ZenPanda lifts arms, palms touching above the head as mandalas bloom. It releases a joyful laugh, butterflies spiraling outward. Hands lower slowly, gathering light into the heart. Panda bows slightly before repeating the aura bloom.

Animation: Mist Retreat
Animation description: Body fades into semi-transparent fog; halo fractures into shards. Eyes shimmer with tears; smile disappears. Cushion evaporates, replaced by swirling mist gateway. Paws reach toward the viewer before receding. Background darkens to indigo. Panda reaches outward, mist wrapping around its arms. It steps backward into the fog, halo shards orbiting nervously. The figure dissolves waist-down, leaving drifting beads. Mist swallows the rest, then clears to the initial reach.

Animation: Serenity Lantern
Animation description: ZenPanda lies on its side atop the cushion, fur silvered. Halo transforms into a paper lantern hovering above. Eyes closed peacefully; paws cradle the mala beads. Fireflies circle slowly, casting warm light. Incense smoke forms a final lotus outline. Panda exhales, releasing incense smoke that traces a lotus above. The lantern ignites softly, illuminating the closed eyes. Fireflies settle onto the beads, pulsing together once. Light dims, leaving the lantern glowing faintly before the loop restarts.
