# Thermagon

Pet visual description: Sleek dragon hatchling with segmented armor plates resembling thermometer ticks and dual elemental horns (one icy, one molten). Palette shifts between frosty blues and molten reds, with a neutral lavender base for balanced moments. Face: large expressive eyes with gradient irises, small snout emitting steam or frost, and soft fins framing the cheeks. Accessories: floating temperature gauge halo, jeweled collar that changes color per state, and drifting climate glyphs. Body coils in a spiral occupying the dial center, tail wrapping near the battery complication.

Animation: Equilibrium Curl
Animation description: Thermagon curls around a floating thermometer, base scales lavender with subtle blue/red highlights. Eyes calm, fins relaxed; halo glows soft white. Tail tip flicks lazily, drawing smoke rings and frost puffs alternately. Temperature glyphs drift upward like soap bubbles. Background remains dark with faint gradient arcs. Thermagon inhales, thermometer line centering while halo brightens. It exhales a mixed mist of warm and cool particles that swirl into yin-yang patterns. The dragon stretches slightly, claws tapping the thermometer. It relaxes back into the curl, halo returning to baseline.

Animation: Harmony Breath
Animation description: Scales glow dual-tone: left side icy cyan, right side ember orange. Eyes sparkle; collar shines gold. Thermometer spins slowly above the head, stable at center. Props: blooming snowflakes and embers that merge mid-air. Body hovers slightly, tail spiraling outward. Thermagon lifts its head, drawing equal parts flame and frost into its lungs. It exhales a ribbon that splits into two colors before fusing. The dragon traces a circle with its tail, capturing the ribbon into an infinity loop. It nods proudly as the loop shrinks back into the halo.

Animation: Heatwave Flush
Animation description: Scales flare orange-red; icy horn melts slightly, dripping steam. Eyes narrow with urgency; collar glows warning crimson. Halo tilts, thermometer rising dangerously. Props: shimmering heat distortion and sweat droplets. Body fans wings desperately to create airflow. Thermagon pants, tongue out, as heat shimmer warps the background. It beats wings rapidly, forcing hot air upward while sparks fall. The dragon sprays a mist from its icy horn to cool itself. It slumps, exhausted, before looping the frantic fanning.

Animation: Cold Snap Shiver
Animation description: Scales turn pale blue; molten horn frosts over. Eyes droop; body trembles. Halo dims; thermometer line dips too low. Props: drifting snow, tiny icicles forming on the tail. Body coils tighter to conserve heat. Thermagon shivers, hugging its tail close to the chest. It breathes out frosty puffs that immediately crystallize. The dragon rubs its claws together, sparks barely forming. It curls tighter, eyes closing, before repeating the shiver.

Animation: Aurora Tempest
Animation description: Scales shimmer with rainbow aurora bands; horns radiate synchronized pulses. Eyes wide with delight; collar sparkles platinum. Halo expands into layered rings. Props: swirling aurora curtains and glittering temperature glyphs. Body pirouettes midair, tail painting spirals. Thermagon spins, releasing alternating jets of flame and snow that weave a helix. It flips upside down, horns shooting light beams into the halo. The dragon laughs, scattering aurora sparks from its claws. It settles back upright, helix collapsing into twinkling dust before repeating.

Animation: Elemental Rift
Animation description: Body elongates into a streak split between fire and ice. Eyes look back mournfully; horns crack with energy. Halo fractures, revealing a portal shaped like a temperature gauge. Tail unravels into a ribbon of steam and frost. Thermometer bursts into shards trailing behind. Thermagon hesitates, claws gripping the portal edge. It dives through, leaving a blazing/frozen trail twisting together. The halo fragments spiral inward after the dragon. Portal snaps shut, leaving drifting shards before the loop restarts.

Animation: Thermal Lantern
Animation description: Dragon rests coiled around a lantern-shaped thermometer filled with liquid light. Scales become translucent glass, revealing extinguished embers and frost. Eyes closed peacefully; horns soften into gentle curves. Halo floats above as a dim halo flame. Snow and ash fall together softly. Thermagon exhales a final wisp that lights the lantern. The lantern glows once, illuminating the transparent scales. Embers fade, frost melts, and the tail unwinds slowly. The halo flame flickers out before rewinding to the last breath.
