# CosmoBond Thermagon Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion focusing on dramatic temperature lighting transitions and elemental particles.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, obsidian background (#030305), and centered camera to capture dual-fire-and-ice breath.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, enhance glow composites in Fusion, and deliver GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Sleek dragon hatchling with segmented armor plates resembling thermometer ticks and dual elemental horns (one icy, one molten).
- Palette shifts between frosty blues and molten reds, with a neutral lavender base for balanced moments.
- Face: large expressive eyes with gradient irises, small snout emitting steam or frost, and soft fins framing the cheeks.
- Accessories: floating temperature gauge halo, jeweled collar that changes color per state, and drifting climate glyphs.
- Body coils in a spiral occupying the dial center, tail wrapping near the battery complication.

## Interaction Map
- **Temperature Balance:** Triggered when skin temp or ambient sensor aligns with healthy range, showcasing balanced breaths.
- **Climate Response:** Fires when extreme heat or cold is detected, guiding the user to adjust environment through stylized reactions.

## Animation States

### Idle State — "Equilibrium Curl"
- **Title:** Equilibrium Curl
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Thermagon curls around a floating thermometer, base scales lavender with subtle blue/red highlights.
  - Eyes calm, fins relaxed; halo glows soft white.
  - Tail tip flicks lazily, drawing smoke rings and frost puffs alternately.
  - Temperature glyphs drift upward like soap bubbles.
  - Background remains dark with faint gradient arcs.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon inhales, thermometer line centering while halo brightens.
  2. It exhales a mixed mist of warm and cool particles that swirl into yin-yang patterns.
  3. The dragon stretches slightly, claws tapping the thermometer.
  4. It relaxes back into the curl, halo returning to baseline.

### Interaction State — Temperature Balance "Harmony Breath"
- **Title:** Harmony Breath
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Scales glow dual-tone: left side icy cyan, right side ember orange.
  - Eyes sparkle; collar shines gold.
  - Thermometer spins slowly above the head, stable at center.
  - Props: blooming snowflakes and embers that merge mid-air.
  - Body hovers slightly, tail spiraling outward.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon lifts its head, drawing equal parts flame and frost into its lungs.
  2. It exhales a ribbon that splits into two colors before fusing.
  3. The dragon traces a circle with its tail, capturing the ribbon into an infinity loop.
  4. It nods proudly as the loop shrinks back into the halo.

### Interaction State — Climate Response "Heatwave Flush"
- **Title:** Heatwave Flush
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Scales flare orange-red; icy horn melts slightly, dripping steam.
  - Eyes narrow with urgency; collar glows warning crimson.
  - Halo tilts, thermometer rising dangerously.
  - Props: shimmering heat distortion and sweat droplets.
  - Body fans wings desperately to create airflow.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon pants, tongue out, as heat shimmer warps the background.
  2. It beats wings rapidly, forcing hot air upward while sparks fall.
  3. The dragon sprays a mist from its icy horn to cool itself.
  4. It slumps, exhausted, before looping the frantic fanning.

### Sick State — "Cold Snap Shiver"
- **Title:** Cold Snap Shiver
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Scales turn pale blue; molten horn frosts over.
  - Eyes droop; body trembles.
  - Halo dims; thermometer line dips too low.
  - Props: drifting snow, tiny icicles forming on the tail.
  - Body coils tighter to conserve heat.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon shivers, hugging its tail close to the chest.
  2. It breathes out frosty puffs that immediately crystallize.
  3. The dragon rubs its claws together, sparks barely forming.
  4. It curls tighter, eyes closing, before repeating the shiver.

### Happy State — "Aurora Tempest"
- **Title:** Aurora Tempest
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Scales shimmer with rainbow aurora bands; horns radiate synchronized pulses.
  - Eyes wide with delight; collar sparkles platinum.
  - Halo expands into layered rings.
  - Props: swirling aurora curtains and glittering temperature glyphs.
  - Body pirouettes midair, tail painting spirals.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon spins, releasing alternating jets of flame and snow that weave a helix.
  2. It flips upside down, horns shooting light beams into the halo.
  3. The dragon laughs, scattering aurora sparks from its claws.
  4. It settles back upright, helix collapsing into twinkling dust before repeating.

### Runaway State — "Elemental Rift"
- **Title:** Elemental Rift
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body elongates into a streak split between fire and ice.
  - Eyes look back mournfully; horns crack with energy.
  - Halo fractures, revealing a portal shaped like a temperature gauge.
  - Tail unravels into a ribbon of steam and frost.
  - Thermometer bursts into shards trailing behind.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon hesitates, claws gripping the portal edge.
  2. It dives through, leaving a blazing/frozen trail twisting together.
  3. The halo fragments spiral inward after the dragon.
  4. Portal snaps shut, leaving drifting shards before the loop restarts.

### Death State — "Thermal Lantern"
- **Title:** Thermal Lantern
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Dragon rests coiled around a lantern-shaped thermometer filled with liquid light.
  - Scales become translucent glass, revealing extinguished embers and frost.
  - Eyes closed peacefully; horns soften into gentle curves.
  - Halo floats above as a dim halo flame.
  - Snow and ash fall together softly.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. Thermagon exhales a final wisp that lights the lantern.
  2. The lantern glows once, illuminating the transparent scales.
  3. Embers fade, frost melts, and the tail unwinds slowly.
  4. The halo flame flickers out before rewinding to the last breath.
