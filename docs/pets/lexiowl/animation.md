# LexiOwl

Pet visual description: Scholarly owl with heart-shaped face, layered feathers resembling stacked book pages, and quill-tipped wings. Palette: indigo body, cream face, and amber feather edges with metallic gold accents. Face: oversized round glasses, thoughtful amber eyes, and a tiny beak; art style nods to storybook etchings. Accessories: floating dictionary tome, bookmark tassels, and letter tiles orbiting the wings. Perches atop a brass armillary sphere occupying the dial center.

Animation: Armillary Perch
Animation description: LexiOwl perches calmly with wings folded; feathers shimmer softly. Glasses glint; eyes blink slowly. Armillary rings rotate gently with subtle reflections. Letter tiles drift lazily, forming faint words. Bookmark tassel sways. Owl adjusts glasses with one wing tip, eyes focusing. It ruffles feathers, sending dust motes into the air. Armillary ring spins a quarter turn; letter tiles rearrange. Owl settles back, closing eyes momentarily.

Animation: Lexicon Beam
Animation description: Feathers glow indigo; glasses project holographic syllables. Wings extend, quill tips shining. Dictionary tome opens, pages flipping rapidly. Letter tiles align into sentences. Background darkens to spotlight the owl. LexiOwl spreads wings, summoning a ribbon of glowing text. It traces the ribbon with a quill feather, highlighting syllables. The owl nods approvingly, eyes following the line. Pages snap shut gently, resetting for the next lesson.

Animation: Feather Flip
Animation description: Palette brightens with gold sparkles. Owl flips upside down mid-air; glasses stay perfectly aligned. Armillary rings explode with celebratory symbols (checkmarks, stars). Dictionary closes, acting as a springboard. Tail feathers fan out like a ribbon. LexiOwl launches upward, wings tucked. Mid-air, it flips, scattering gold letters. The owl lands on the tome, which compresses and rebounds. It bows with wings outstretched before looping.

Animation: Missed Session
Animation description: Feathers dull; glasses slide down the beak. Eyes droop; armillary slows almost to a stop. Letter tiles fall to the base, forming jumbled piles. Tome closes with a sigh. Owl hunches, wings wrapping around itself. LexiOwl yawns, rubbing eyes with a wing. It tries to open the tome, but the pages refuse. The owl slumps, feathers ruffled. Tiles tumble again, prompting another weary sigh.

Animation: Polyglot Waltz
Animation description: Feathers shimmer with shifting gradients representing different languages. Glasses sparkle; eyes joyful. Armillary rings spin in choreography; letter tiles dance around the owl. Tome floats, projecting translations. Owl waltzes mid-air with gentle twirls. LexiOwl hops off the sphere, gliding gracefully. It twirls, wings tracing elegant calligraphy strokes. Translations flash around the body as it laughs. The owl lands lightly, ready to dance again.

Animation: Library Fade
Animation description: Body becomes semi-transparent parchment; feathers turn to fluttering pages. Glasses fall slowly toward the viewer. Armillary dissolves into floating ink. A doorway shaped like a library shelf opens behind. Letter tiles swirl into a whirlwind. LexiOwl looks back wistfully, clutching the tome. It steps backward into the shelf doorway, pages peeling away. Glasses drift down, caught by invisible wind. Doorway closes, leaving only swirling letters before reset.

Animation: Gilded Volume
Animation description: Owl transforms into a golden embossed relief on the tome cover. Glasses rest atop the book; wings etched into the surface. Armillary rings collapse into a bookmark clasp. Soft light emanates from engraved text. Letter tiles arrange into "Forever Learning". LexiOwl exhales, feathers turning to gold dust. Dust settles onto the tome, forming the relief. Bookmark clasp locks with a gentle click. Light pulses once through the title before the loop rewinds.
