# LumiLizard

Pet visual description: Bi-form dragon-chameleon hybrid with smooth plated scales, slender limbs, and translucent frill sails stretching from head to tail. Day palette blends goldenrod, amber, and coral; night palette shifts to cobalt, indigo, and violet with speckles that mimic stars. Face: elongated snout, luminous slit-pupil eyes, and expressive frill eyelids; art style references stylized vaporwave creature design. Accessories: sunstone pendant at the throat, crescent anklets, and hovering light-meter orbs. Occupies central dial while curling tail along the lower arc, keeping the clock hands unobstructed.

Animation: Twilight Pulse Perch
Animation description: Base scales shimmer from amber shoulders to cobalt tail tip, reflecting both sun and moon hues. Eyes remain soft crescents; frill sails half-open like stained glass wings. Sunstone pendant glows steady, projecting faint concentric rings on the chest. LumiLizard perches on a floating stone spire with subtle moss textures. Light-meter orbs orbit lazily, changing from warm to cool tones every few seconds. The lizard inhales, chest plates separating slightly as the pendant brightens. It tilts its head toward the sun orb, frill catching warm light and casting patterned shadows. Tail curls around the spire, dragging glowing runes across the moss before releasing them as fireflies. LumiLizard exhales, frill lowering, and the orbs swap color temperature to reset the loop.

Animation: Helio Bloom Stretch
Animation description: Scales blaze gold with white-hot highlights; frill fully unfurls to resemble a sunflower. Eyes widen with circular pupils; facial expression energized. Sunstone pendant emits rays that create lens flares across the frame. Props: floating sundial, shimmering heat haze, and drifting pollen specks. Body arches upward, claws gripping the sun dial rim. LumiLizard climbs atop the sundial, spreading frill sails wide as sunlight cascades through them. It stretches its spine, mouth open in a silent roar, releasing golden particles that shower downward. The tail traces a spiral on the dial, igniting glyphs that spin like clock hands. It settles back into the arch, frill pulsing with residual light before repeating the stretch.

Animation: Lunar Veil Watch
Animation description: Palette cools to deep indigo with constellations twinkling beneath translucent scales. Eyes turn silver with reflective pupils; expression serene. Frill folds downward, forming layered crescent shapes. Props: floating moonstone mirror, drifting meteor dust, and a glowing firefly companion. Body reclines on a hovering crystalline platform. LumiLizard taps the moonstone mirror, ripples forming concentric arcs of light. It gazes into the reflection, eyes glowing as constellations align across its frill. The firefly companion circles the snout, leaving violet trails the lizard gently follows with its gaze. A calm exhale releases cool mist that settles onto the platform before the loop restarts.

Animation: Overexposed Glare
Animation description: Colors wash out to pale yellow-white with harsh highlights; scales crackle with noise. Eyes squint, pupils shrinking; expression pained. Frill curls inward for protection, edges fraying. Sunstone pendant flickers erratically, projecting broken rays. Body crouches low on the spire, shielding face with claws. LumiLizard shields its eyes, grimacing as blinding light flashes across the screen. It sways unsteadily, frill twitching, while the pendant sputters and sparks. The tail lashes weakly, releasing scorched embers that fall lifelessly. Exhausted, it curls tighter, breathing shallowly before repeating the painful glare.

Animation: Dual Aura Pirouette
Animation description: Body splits into mirrored halves: warm gold on the left, cool indigo on the right, with a luminous seam. Eyes sparkle with starburst irises; smile playful. Frill forms symmetrical petals with alternating colors. Props: yin-yang halo swirling overhead and radiant sparkles following each movement. Body pirouettes mid-air while tail draws infinity loops. LumiLizard leaps from the spire, spinning gracefully with frill petals fanning outward. It extends forearms, releasing alternating warm and cool light ribbons. The tail draws an infinity symbol that ignites the halo above. The pet lands lightly, giggling, before springing back into the next pirouette.

Animation: Horizon Slip
Animation description: Body elongates into a streak blending dusk colors; edges blur into heat shimmer. Eyes glance backward, filled with regret. Frill tightens, acting like aerodynamic fins. Spire crumbles behind as a glowing portal shaped like a horizon line opens ahead. Light-meter orbs fall away like spent embers. LumiLizard hesitates atop the breaking spire, tail twitching nervously. It springs toward the horizon portal, leaving a trail of split warm/cool light. Mid-leap, the frill folds, and the pet becomes semi-transparent, blending with the sky. The portal seals, swallowing the trail, leaving only drifting embers before reset.

Animation: Solar-Lunar Husk
Animation description: Scales turn translucent glass, revealing fading embers and starlight within. Eyes close; frill droops gently, edges glowing faintly. Sunstone pendant cracks, leaking beams that solidify into floating shards. Body rests atop the spire, coiled peacefully with tail over snout. A halo of alternating day/night segments hovers above like a memorial clock. LumiLizard exhales a final breath that splits into warm and cool wisps circling the body. The pendant fractures, shards levitating to form a protective ring. Light drains from the scales, leaving a glass-like husk bathed in halo glow. The halo dims to a single pulse before rewinding to the initial exhale.
