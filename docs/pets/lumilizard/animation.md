# CosmoBond LumiLizard Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion with painterly lighting transitions that accentuate solar-to-lunar gradients.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, twilight charcoal (#050608) background, and locked three-quarter camera so tail curls never clip complications.
- **Post-processing:** Normalize to 60 fps PNG stacks, manually enhance rim lights in Krita, and package GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets for deployment.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Bi-form dragon-chameleon hybrid with smooth plated scales, slender limbs, and translucent frill sails stretching from head to tail.
- Day palette blends goldenrod, amber, and coral; night palette shifts to cobalt, indigo, and violet with speckles that mimic stars.
- Face: elongated snout, luminous slit-pupil eyes, and expressive frill eyelids; art style references stylized vaporwave creature design.
- Accessories: sunstone pendant at the throat, crescent anklets, and hovering light-meter orbs.
- Occupies central dial while curling tail along the lower arc, keeping the clock hands unobstructed.

## Interaction Map
- **Sun Soak Ritual:** Triggered when the user logs daylight exposure or accepts the "step outside" prompt, focusing on radiant solar energy.
- **Moonlit Reflection:** Activated when the user practices evening wind-down or toggles night-focus mode, highlighting calm nocturnal observation.

## Animation States

### Idle State — "Twilight Pulse Perch"
- **Title:** Twilight Pulse Perch
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Base scales shimmer from amber shoulders to cobalt tail tip, reflecting both sun and moon hues.
  - Eyes remain soft crescents; frill sails half-open like stained glass wings.
  - Sunstone pendant glows steady, projecting faint concentric rings on the chest.
  - LumiLizard perches on a floating stone spire with subtle moss textures.
  - Light-meter orbs orbit lazily, changing from warm to cool tones every few seconds.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. The lizard inhales, chest plates separating slightly as the pendant brightens.
  2. It tilts its head toward the sun orb, frill catching warm light and casting patterned shadows.
  3. Tail curls around the spire, dragging glowing runes across the moss before releasing them as fireflies.
  4. LumiLizard exhales, frill lowering, and the orbs swap color temperature to reset the loop.

### Interaction State — Sun Soak Ritual "Helio Bloom Stretch"
- **Title:** Helio Bloom Stretch
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Scales blaze gold with white-hot highlights; frill fully unfurls to resemble a sunflower.
  - Eyes widen with circular pupils; facial expression energized.
  - Sunstone pendant emits rays that create lens flares across the frame.
  - Props: floating sundial, shimmering heat haze, and drifting pollen specks.
  - Body arches upward, claws gripping the sun dial rim.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. LumiLizard climbs atop the sundial, spreading frill sails wide as sunlight cascades through them.
  2. It stretches its spine, mouth open in a silent roar, releasing golden particles that shower downward.
  3. The tail traces a spiral on the dial, igniting glyphs that spin like clock hands.
  4. It settles back into the arch, frill pulsing with residual light before repeating the stretch.

### Interaction State — Moonlit Reflection "Lunar Veil Watch"

- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Palette cools to deep indigo with constellations twinkling beneath translucent scales.
  - Eyes turn silver with reflective pupils; expression serene.
  - Frill folds downward, forming layered crescent shapes.
  - Props: floating moonstone mirror, drifting meteor dust, and a glowing firefly companion.
  - Body reclines on a hovering crystalline platform.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. LumiLizard taps the moonstone mirror, ripples forming concentric arcs of light.
  2. It gazes into the reflection, eyes glowing as constellations align across its frill.
  3. The firefly companion circles the snout, leaving violet trails the lizard gently follows with its gaze.
  4. A calm exhale releases cool mist that settles onto the platform before the loop restarts.

### Sick State — "Overexposed Glare"

  - Body crouches low on the spire, shielding face with claws.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. LumiLizard shields its eyes, grimacing as blinding light flashes across the screen.
  2. It sways unsteadily, frill twitching, while the pendant sputters and sparks.
  3. The tail lashes weakly, releasing scorched embers that fall lifelessly.
  4. Exhausted, it curls tighter, breathing shallowly before repeating the painful glare.

### Happy State — "Dual Aura Pirouette"

  - Body pirouettes mid-air while tail draws infinity loops.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. LumiLizard leaps from the spire, spinning gracefully with frill petals fanning outward.
  2. It extends forearms, releasing alternating warm and cool light ribbons.
  3. The tail draws an infinity symbol that ignites the halo above.
  4. The pet lands lightly, giggling, before springing back into the next pirouette.

### Runaway State — "Horizon Slip"
- **Title:** Horizon Slip
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body elongates into a streak blending dusk colors; edges blur into heat shimmer.
  - Eyes glance backward, filled with regret.
  - Frill tightens, acting like aerodynamic fins.
  - Spire crumbles behind as a glowing portal shaped like a horizon line opens ahead.
  - Light-meter orbs fall away like spent embers.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. LumiLizard hesitates atop the breaking spire, tail twitching nervously.
  2. It springs toward the horizon portal, leaving a trail of split warm/cool light.
