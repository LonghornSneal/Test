# Mounty

Pet visual description: Mountain goat with shaggy graphite fur, frosted horns shaped like carabiners, and muscular limbs built for bounding. Palette combines slate gray, ice blue hooves, and bright saffron climbing harness straps. Face: square jaw, keen jade eyes, and playful goatee; art style resembles inked expedition posters. Accessories: bandana map around the neck, miniature ice axe tucked into the harness, and floating altitude ticker. Positioned near the center with hooves gripping stylized cliff ledges carved into the dial.

Animation: Ridge Breath
Animation description: Mounty balances on a jagged ledge with snow dust swirling slowly. Fur gently flutters; harness straps sway. Eyes scan the valley while the altitude ticker glows soft blue. Tail flicks occasionally, shaking off snowflakes. A thin rope dangles from the harness, tapping the ledge. Mounty inhales deeply, chest expanding as misty breath rises. It shifts weight between front hooves, testing the ledge. The goat flicks its rope, knocking loose pebbles that tumble downward. It exhales, horns glinting, before repeating the calm stance.

Animation: Granite Sprint
Animation description: Fur darkens with sweat sheen; hooves glow ice blue. Eyes narrow with focus; teeth grit. Harness straps tighten, and the rope coils close. Props: falling gravel, chalk dust trails, and altitude ticker pulsing green. Body stretched diagonally as it scales a cliff face. Mounty lunges upward, hooves striking the rock and emitting sparks. It plants the ice axe, leveraging the body over a ledge. The goat kicks off, sending chalk dust spiraling in its wake. It hooks a horn on a protrusion, swings up, and resets for another sprint.

Animation: Flag Crest
Animation description: Fur brightens; harness glows saffron. Eyes gleam with pride; grin wide. Mounty holds a pennant flag featuring the CosmoBond emblem. Props: confetti snowflakes, golden sunbeams, and floating altitude numbers. Body stands atop a peak stone with front hooves planted firmly. Mounty drives the flagpole into the summit, causing a ring of light. It rears up, horns catching the sunbeams, scattering glittering ice crystals. The goat bows to the viewer, flag fluttering dramatically. It stomps twice, shaking loose celebratory snow before repeating.

Animation: Overworked Exhaust
Animation description: Fur droops, appearing damp; colors muted. Eyes half-lidded with dark circles; mouth slack. Harness straps dangle; rope tangled around legs. Altitude ticker flashes amber warnings. Body slumps against the cliff, knees shaking. Mounty stumbles, catching itself with trembling hooves. It coughs, releasing a puff of chalk and snow. The goat leans heavily on the ice axe, eyes glazing. It slides downward a few inches, then weakly resets.

Animation: Peak Prance
Animation description: Fur regains glossy highlights; horns sparkle. Eyes shine; goatee flutters as it laughs. Harness straps twirl like ribbons around the torso. Props: dancing avalanche beacons and musical chimes. Body prances along a ridge with nimble steps. Mounty hops from rock to rock, leaving glowing hoofprints. It tosses its head, horns ringing like bells. The goat performs a sideways kick, sending snowflakes swirling into heart shapes. It lands gracefully, tail flicking, before repeating the prance.

Animation: Avalanche Escape
Animation description: Colors streak into gray-white blur; fur windblown. Eyes wide with urgency; horns angled backward. Snowwall forms behind, chasing the goat downhill. Rope snaps free, trailing wildly. Tail straightens for balance as rocks crumble. Mounty looks back at the looming snowwall, eyes filled with regret. It sprints down the slope, hooves throwing sparks and snow plumes. The goat leaps across a chasm, nearly losing footing as debris flies. It disappears into a cloud of snow, leaving only the rope fluttering before the loop restarts.

Animation: Frost Cairn
Animation description: Mounty lies peacefully atop stacked ice blocks etched with runes. Fur turns frosted silver; eyes closed with serene smile. Horns emit faint aurora light arcs. Harness neatly folded beside the body; rope coils like a wreath. Snow gently falls, accumulating softly. The goat exhales a final frosty breath that crystallizes midair. Auroras shimmer along the horns, illuminating the cairn. Snow covers the hooves gradually, leaving only the horns visible. Light fades to a gentle glow before rewinding to the last breath.
