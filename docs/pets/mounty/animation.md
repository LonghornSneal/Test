# CosmoBond Mounty Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion tuned for dynamic climb animations with textured ink outlines.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, alpine slate (#0B1115) background, and low-angle camera pointing upward to emphasize elevation.
- **Post-processing:** Normalize to 60 fps PNG stacks, add chalk dust particles in After Effects, and ship GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Mountain goat with shaggy graphite fur, frosted horns shaped like carabiners, and muscular limbs built for bounding.
- Palette combines slate gray, ice blue hooves, and bright saffron climbing harness straps.
- Face: square jaw, keen jade eyes, and playful goatee; art style resembles inked expedition posters.
- Accessories: bandana map around the neck, miniature ice axe tucked into the harness, and floating altitude ticker.
- Positioned near the center with hooves gripping stylized cliff ledges carved into the dial.

## Interaction Map
- **Climb Push:** Triggered when elevation gain or floor counts spike, showing intense climbing bursts.
- **Summit Celebration:** Fires when the user reaches a milestone or sets a new personal best, focusing on flag-plant theatrics.
