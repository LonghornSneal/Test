# CosmoBond SomnoSloth Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion with soft watercolor shading and cinematic depth-of-field tailored for dreamlike sloth loops.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, midnight navy (#040713) holdout background, and locked camera with gentle tilt to preserve breathing motion.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, paint subtle glow bloom around bioluminescent spores in Photoshop, and compile GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- SomnoSloth is a plush lavender sloth with elongated limbs, a cloud-soft belly, and stardust freckles sprinkled across its fur.
- Palette blends lavender, periwinkle, and muted peach with cream facial mask lines inspired by Ghibli bedtime scenes.
- Face: droopy teardrop eyes with galaxy irises, a tiny button nose, and a perpetual sleepy smile framed by rosy cheeks.
- Accessories: moon-pillow harness, dangling tassel dreamcatcher earrings, and a glowing pocket watch embedded in its chest fur.
- Scale: reclines across the bottom half of the dial, leaving ample sky space for complications; body posture usually hammock-like.

## Interaction Map
- **Guided Wind-Down:** Fires when the user starts the Somno breathing or bedtime routine, showing rocking motions and candle props.
- **Dream Journal Entry:** Triggered when the user logs reflections after waking, inviting parchment scrolls and gentle writing gestures.

## Animation States

### Idle State — "Moonlit Sway"
- **Title:** Moonlit Sway
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Base lavender fur glows softly, with pastel gradients radiating from the pocket watch.
  - Eyes remain half-lidded, shimmering like tide pools; smile relaxed.
  - Moon-pillow harness suspends the sloth in midair; tassels drift slowly.
  - Background features distant constellations and drifting pollen motes.
  - Body rocks gently as if in a hammock, toes curling inward.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. SomnoSloth exhales, shoulders dropping while the pillow dips and releases a ring of stardust.
  2. It inhales deeply, belly expanding and pocket watch brightening, eyes glowing brighter for a beat.
  3. One arm lazily swings down, fingertips skimming through floating pollen which spiral upward.
  4. The sloth curls its toes, giving a miniature kick that sets the harness swaying the opposite direction.
  5. As the motion slows, eyelids flutter closed, tassels settle, and the pose resets to the opening sway.

### Interaction State — Guided Wind-Down "Candle Rock Ritual"
- **Title:** Candle Rock Ritual
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Fur takes on warmer hues (lavender to peach gradient) lit by floating candles.
  - Eyes fully close, lashes casting long shadows; mouth forms a peaceful "o" inhale.

  - Props: trio of levitating candles, drifting incense smoke, and a translucent breathing meter shaped like a crescent.
  - Arms cradle the pocket watch as if hugging a plush toy.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. SomnoSloth rocks backward, candles rising while the breathing meter pulses "4" for inhale.
  2. It leans forward, exhaling through pursed lips; incense trails wrap around its wrists.
  3. The sloth raises one hand to trace a figure-eight with the smoke, drawing constellations in the air.
  4. It presses the pocket watch to its cheek, smile widening, and the cradle glows softly before the loop restarts.

  - Body leans against a velvet cushion, knees folded under the torso.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. SomnoSloth dips the moonlit quill into a glowing inkwell hovering above the scroll.
  2. It writes flowing glyphs, each stroke creating tiny dream bubbles that drift upward.
  3. The sloth pauses, tapping its chin with the quill while eyes glance to the sky, letting a comet streak by.

  - Body curls into itself, tail wrapping around ankles.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. SomnoSloth clutches the deflated pillow, shivering slightly as the temperature glyph flashes amber.
  2. It rolls to one side, tugging at tangled tassels, then sighs with frustration.

  1. SomnoSloth squeezes the lotus pillow, releasing petals that swirl around the frame.
  2. It twirls midair, aurora ribbons trailing, and giggles with open-mouth delight.
  3. The sloth stretches arms wide as miniature moons orbit, then clasps hands at heart center to form a glowing heart shape.
