# SomnoSloth

Pet visual description: SomnoSloth is a plush lavender sloth with elongated limbs, a cloud-soft belly, and stardust freckles sprinkled across its fur. Palette blends lavender, periwinkle, and muted peach with cream facial mask lines inspired by Ghibli bedtime scenes. Face: droopy teardrop eyes with galaxy irises, a tiny button nose, and a perpetual sleepy smile framed by rosy cheeks. Accessories: moon-pillow harness, dangling tassel dreamcatcher earrings, and a glowing pocket watch embedded in its chest fur. Scale: reclines across the bottom half of the dial, leaving ample sky space for complications; body posture usually hammock-like.

Animation: Moonlit Sway
Animation description: Base lavender fur glows softly, with pastel gradients radiating from the pocket watch. Eyes remain half-lidded, shimmering like tide pools; smile relaxed. Moon-pillow harness suspends the sloth in midair; tassels drift slowly. Background features distant constellations and drifting pollen motes. Body rocks gently as if in a hammock, toes curling inward. SomnoSloth exhales, shoulders dropping while the pillow dips and releases a ring of stardust. It inhales deeply, belly expanding and pocket watch brightening, eyes glowing brighter for a beat. One arm lazily swings down, fingertips skimming through floating pollen which spiral upward. The sloth curls its toes, giving a miniature kick that sets the harness swaying the opposite direction. As the motion slows, eyelids flutter closed, tassels settle, and the pose resets to the opening sway.

Animation: Candle Rock Ritual
Animation description: Fur takes on warmer hues (lavender to peach gradient) lit by floating candles. Eyes fully close, lashes casting long shadows; mouth forms a peaceful "o" inhale. Moon-pillow morphs into a crescent cradle lined with golden embroidery. Props: trio of levitating candles, drifting incense smoke, and a translucent breathing meter shaped like a crescent. Arms cradle the pocket watch as if hugging a plush toy. SomnoSloth rocks backward, candles rising while the breathing meter pulses "4" for inhale. It leans forward, exhaling through pursed lips; incense trails wrap around its wrists. The sloth raises one hand to trace a figure-eight with the smoke, drawing constellations in the air. It presses the pocket watch to its cheek, smile widening, and the cradle glows softly before the loop restarts.

Animation: Star Scribble Serenade
Animation description: Colors shift to pastel blues with glittering silver freckles along the arms. Eyes open wider showing shimmering galaxy irises; expression thoughtful. A floating parchment scroll unfurls beside the sloth, illuminated by bioluminescent moths. Feather quill made of moonlight attaches to the sloth's index claw, leaving sparkling ink. Body leans against a velvet cushion, knees folded under the torso. SomnoSloth dips the moonlit quill into a glowing inkwell hovering above the scroll. It writes flowing glyphs, each stroke creating tiny dream bubbles that drift upward. The sloth pauses, tapping its chin with the quill while eyes glance to the sky, letting a comet streak by. It smiles, signs the entry with a flourish, then rewinds the parchment partially before repeating.

Animation: Restless Toss
Animation description: Fur pales to muted gray-lavender with ruffled clumps; cheeks flush faint pink. Eyes stay barely open with visible dark circles; smile disappears into a worried line. Moon-pillow deflates unevenly, and tassels tangle into knots. Props: wilting night-bloom flowers and a flickering temperature glyph near the pocket watch. Body curls into itself, tail wrapping around ankles. SomnoSloth clutches the deflated pillow, shivering slightly as the temperature glyph flashes amber. It rolls to one side, tugging at tangled tassels, then sighs with frustration. The pet coughs softly, releasing dull gray sparkles that fall immediately. Exhausted, it flops onto its back, eyes staring blankly upward before repeating the restless toss.

Animation: Aurora Cuddle Bloom
Animation description: Fur radiates neon gradients of teal, magenta, and gold; freckles glow like tiny suns. Eyes sparkle fully open with star-shaped highlights; smile beams. Moon-pillow blooms into a lotus cloud sprouting luminous petals. Props: cascading aurora ribbons, fluttering dreamcatcher feathers, and miniature moons orbiting the pocket watch. Body hugs the pillow, toes flexed outward, tail swaying slowly. SomnoSloth squeezes the lotus pillow, releasing petals that swirl around the frame. It twirls midair, aurora ribbons trailing, and giggles with open-mouth delight. The sloth stretches arms wide as miniature moons orbit, then clasps hands at heart center to form a glowing heart shape. It nestles back into the lotus, eyes closing with contentment before repeating the joyful hug.

Animation: Hammock Vanish
Animation description: Colors elongate into streaks of pale lavender; edges blur like double exposure. Eyes look over the shoulder sadly; mouth tightens. Moon-pillow frays into glowing threads that form a doorway toward the stars. Background constellations stretch, creating a tunnel effect. Body reaches toward the viewer with one paw while the rest slips into the doorway. SomnoSloth loosens its grip on the pillow, threads snapping into particles. It floats backward toward the star doorway, leaving a trail of fading glitter. The pet looks back once, tears glistening, before the doorway begins to close. Only the tassels remain, dangling in midair, then they dissolve as the loop resets.

Animation: Starlit Cocoon
Animation description: Body becomes translucent with soft lavender light emanating from within. Eyes close peacefully; smile returns to a faint content line. Moon-pillow weaves around the sloth, forming a cocoon of glowing threads. Props: drifting lanterns shaped like fireflies and a gentle hourglass releasing silver sand upward. Body curls into fetal position, hands over heart. SomnoSloth exhales mist that crystallizes into protective threads wrapping around its limbs. The lanterns gather, bathing the cocoon in golden light as the hourglass reverses its flow. The cocoon seals, pulsing softly, while tiny constellations bloom across the surface. The light slowly dims until only a faint silhouette remains, then rewinds to the first exhale.
