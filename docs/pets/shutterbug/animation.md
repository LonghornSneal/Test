# CosmoBond ShutterBug Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion tailored for macro ladybug shots with camera-flash lighting.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, charcoal studio backdrop (#040408), and gentle dolly motion to accent shell reflections.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, retouch specular highlights in Photoshop, and compile GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Ladybug-inspired pet with glossy red shell, black polka dots resembling camera lenses, and mechanical camera legs.
- Face: expressive compound eyes, petite smile, and retractable viewfinder brows.
- Accessories: mini tripod feet, shoulder-mounted flash, and floating photo prompt cards.
- Size: occupies lower-center dial, leaving top area for complications.

## Interaction Map
- **Photo Snap:** Triggered when the user captures a new photo or meets a prompt, highlighting flash and shutter gestures.
- **Gallery Proud:** Fires when the user reviews albums or meets streaks, showcasing portfolio presentation.
