# ShutterBug

Pet visual description: Ladybug-inspired pet with glossy red shell, black polka dots resembling camera lenses, and mechanical camera legs. Face: expressive compound eyes, petite smile, and retractable viewfinder brows. Accessories: mini tripod feet, shoulder-mounted flash, and floating photo prompt cards. Size: occupies lower-center dial, leaving top area for complications.

Animation: Glow Patrol
Animation description: ShutterBug stands poised on tripod legs; shell glows subtly. Flash unit charges slowly, emitting pulses. Photo prompt cards float lazily around the bug. Eyes blink with calm focus. Background features faint film grain. ShutterBug swivels its head, scanning the frame. Shell dots brighten sequentially like lens indicators. Tripod legs adjust microscopically to stay balanced. Flash breathes once, returning to standby.

Animation: Flash Pop
Animation description: Shell plates slide open, revealing prism cores. Flash blooms bright white; viewfinder brows lower. Legs crouch for stability. Prompt cards align into a targeting bracket. Eyes widen with excitement. ShutterBug crouches, wings slightly open. It focuses, viewfinder projecting framing guides. Flash fires, flooding the scene with light and leaving star trails. Shell clicks shut, and the bug hops joyfully.

Animation: Portfolio Spin
Animation description: Shell becomes translucent, displaying mini photos. Prompt cards transform into hanging prints. Legs extend to form a rotating turntable. Flash softens into gallery lighting. Eyes gleam with pride. ShutterBug rises on extended legs, spinning slowly. Mini photos rotate around the shell, each highlighted by a beam. The bug points to each print with an antenna pointer. It bows slightly before repeating the spin.

Animation: Creative Block
Animation description: Colors desaturate; shell dims. Flash flickers weakly; prompt cards crumple. Legs wobble; viewfinder brows droop. Eyes show fatigue. Background darkens with static noise. ShutterBug attempts a snap, but the flash sputters. It sighs, shell spots blinking unevenly. The bug droops, tripod legs collapsing slightly. Cards fall to the ground before the loop restarts.

Animation: Burst Parade
Animation description: Shell radiates rainbow reflections; lens dots spin. Flash fires rhythmic pulses; prompt cards turn into floating balloons. Legs dance side to side. Eyes sparkle like camera glass. Background fills with bokeh orbs. ShutterBug hops while firing rapid mini flashes. It twirls, releasing balloons shaped like cameras. The bug strikes dynamic poses, capturing imaginary scenes. It lands with a wink, ready to dance again.

Animation: Shutter Fade
Animation description: Body blurs into motion streaks; shell plates detach like shutter blades. Flash extinguishes; prompt cards scatter. Legs retract, transforming into wings. Eyes glance back sadly. Background tunnels into darkness. ShutterBug pauses, shell plates trembling. It bursts forward, shedding shutter blades. Cards flutter behind like discarded negatives. Bug vanishes into a dark tunnel, leaving fading light.

Animation: Film Negative
Animation description: ShutterBug freezes inside a translucent film strip frame. Shell details invert to high-contrast negative colors. Flash becomes a dim bulb; legs fold neatly. Prompt cards freeze mid-air, faded. A sepia vignette surrounds the frame. Film strip materializes around the bug. Colors invert slowly, locking in the negative. The flash bulb flickers once, then burns out. Frame drifts gently before rewinding to the materialization.
