# BusyBee

Pet visual description: Chubby bee with translucent wings, hexagonal thorax segments, and a tiny planner notebook strapped to its waist. Palette: black stripes, golden-yellow body, iridescent wings, and teal eye highlights. Face: large friendly eyes, button nose, and confident smile; art style merges kawaii and infographic iconography. Accessories: honey-meter gauge, floating task icons, and a pen-shaped stinger stylus. Hovers near the top-left quadrant, leaving dial space clear.

Animation: Hive Hover
Animation description: BusyBee hovers with slow wing beats; stripes glow softly. Honey-meter gauge pulses gently. Planner notebook flutters open slightly. Floating hex tiles orbit lazily. Tail stinger rests calmly. Bee dips slightly, wings buzzing quietly. It glances at the honey-meter, nodding contentedly. Notebook pages flip once. Bee returns to neutral hover.

Animation: Waggle Burst
Animation description: Colors saturate; stripes emit light. Wings beat rapidly, creating motion blur. Honey-meter fills to 100% with sparkle overflow. Task icons flip to checkmarks. Tail stinger draws celebratory zigzags. BusyBee performs a figure-eight waggle dance. It pumps fists, releasing honey sparks. The bee spins once, scattering checkmark confetti. It salutes with the stylus before looping the dance.

Animation: Hex Sketch
Animation description: Bee hovers closer to the viewer; eyes focused. Notebook opens fully with glowing grid pages. Tail stylus drips honey ink. Floating hex tiles align into a planning board. Wings slow to minimize movement. BusyBee dips the stinger stylus into a honey inkwell. It sketches hex icons onto the floating board. The bee taps each icon, lighting them up sequentially. It closes the notebook with satisfaction before repeating.

Animation: Overdue Swarm
Animation description: Colors fade; eyes show worry. Tiny gray bees swarm around, representing overdue tasks. Honey-meter drains to near empty. Notebook papers scatter. Wings droop. BusyBee flails, trying to shoo away the gray swarm. It sighs, shoulders sagging as honey drips fall. The bee gathers scattered papers frantically. Exhausted, it droops midair before repeating.

Animation: Honey Halo
Animation description: Bee glows golden; wings form a halo pattern. Honey-meter overflows elegantly. Planner notebook spins, projecting success stamps. Tail stylus draws luminous loops overhead. Floating flowers bloom around the bee. BusyBee rises, wings creating a circular halo. It sprinkles honey droplets that transform into flowers. The bee twirls, stamping "Done" icons in mid-air. It blows a kiss, resetting the halo glow.

Animation: Abandoned Hive
Animation description: Colors streak into muted lines; wings tear slightly. Honey-meter cracks; planner shuts with a thud. Bee darts toward a dark corridor formed by collapsing hex tiles. Task icons shatter behind it. Tail leaves a broken line. BusyBee pauses, looking back with regret. It speeds toward the corridor, dodging falling tiles. The honey-meter bursts, spilling honey as it flies. Bee vanishes into the darkness, trail fading before reset.

Animation: Amber Reliquary
Animation description: Bee encased in translucent amber droplet with suspended hex icons. Wings folded neatly; eyes closed peacefully. Planner notebook and stylus rest beside inside the amber. Soft golden light glows from within. Amber droplet sits atop a pedestal hive. Amber seals around BusyBee, trapping final sparkles. Light pulses gently, illuminating the suspended icons. Pedestal hive emits a warm hum, then quiets. Droplet remains still before loop restart.
