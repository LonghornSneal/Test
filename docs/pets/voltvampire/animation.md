# VoltVampire

Pet visual description: Bat-vampire hybrid with sleek midnight fur, glowing fuchsia eyes, and translucent wings shaped like charging icons. Outfit: royal cape lined with circuitry patterns, gold-trimmed collar, and energy goblet accessory. Accessories: dual battery meters hovering near shoulders and Data Layer spark trails. Hovers above a circular charging sigil etched into the dial.

Animation: Ambient Idle
Animation description: VoltVampire floats with cape gently waving. Eyes half-closed; fangs barely visible. Battery meters glow steady teal. Charging sigil pulses softly. Wings tucked elegantly. Bat inhales, hovering slightly higher. Cape ripples, casting faint lightning shadows. It exhales, lowering back toward the sigil. Battery meters blink once before repeating.

Animation: Plasma Toast
Animation description: Eyes flare bright magenta; cape spreads wide. Energy goblet fills with glowing blue plasma. Wings fan outward with electric arcs. Battery meters spike to full. Sigil emits lightning bolts. VoltVampire raises the goblet dramatically. It drinks the plasma, cheeks glowing as veins light up. The bat spreads wings, releasing energy waves. It bows graciously, ready for the next toast.

Animation: Suspended Drift
Animation description: Colors shift to cool blues; cape wraps around the body. Eyes soften; breathing slows. Battery meters display conservation icons. Sigil dims to a thin outline. Wings fold tightly. VoltVampire tucks into a cocoon pose, arms crossed. It hovers motionless while meters show slow pulsing. A faint spark passes along the cape edge, symbolizing efficient drip charge. Bat relaxes further before restarting.

Animation: Battery Warning
Animation description: Colors desaturate; eyes flicker. Wings droop; cape frays with static. Meters flash red with warning triangles. Sigil cracks, leaking sparks. Expression pained. VoltVampire clutches its chest, staggering. Sparks sputter from wings, falling uselessly. It gasps, staring at the empty goblet. Bat collapses briefly before looping the warning.

Animation: Regal Ascend
Animation description: Fur glows midnight purple; cape becomes a flowing aurora. Eyes shine; fangs gleam. Battery meters orbit like crowns. Sigil transforms into a radiant throne. Wings extend majestically. VoltVampire rises onto the throne, arms open. It conjures twin lightning orbs, juggling them playfully. The bat laughs, releasing a shower of star sparks. Orbs merge back into the meters as it resumes the throne pose.

Animation: Hibernation Flight
Animation description: Body elongates into a streak of red light; cape dissolves into digital bats. Meters shatter, scattering digits. Wings flap frantically toward a shadow portal. Eyes filled with regret. Sigil collapses underfoot. VoltVampire glances back sorrowfully. It launches upward, leaving a comet trail. Digital bats swarm after it into the portal. Portal snaps shut, leaving drifting numbers.

Animation: Crystalline Sarcophagus
Animation description: Bat rests inside a transparent coffin shaped like a battery cell. Cape wraps the body; wings folded peacefully. Meters freeze at zero, glowing faint blue. Sigil becomes etched glass beneath the coffin. Candle-like sparks float at each corner. Coffin seals with a soft hum. Frozen lightning travels across the surface once. Sparks extinguish slowly, leaving the sarcophagus glowing. Light fades to a tranquil glimmer before rewinding.
