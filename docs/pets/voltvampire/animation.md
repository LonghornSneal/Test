# CosmoBond VoltVampire Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion emphasizing neon gothic lighting and electrical particle effects.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second loops, obsidian castle backdrop (#030106), and orbiting camera to highlight cape motion.
- **Post-processing:** Convert to 60 fps PNG stacks, enhance lightning glows in After Effects, and deliver GIF/WebM plus sprite sheets.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- Bat-vampire hybrid with sleek midnight fur, glowing fuchsia eyes, and translucent wings shaped like charging icons.
- Outfit: royal cape lined with circuitry patterns, gold-trimmed collar, and energy goblet accessory.
- Accessories: dual battery meters hovering near shoulders and Data Layer spark trails.
- Hovers above a circular charging sigil etched into the dial.

## Interaction Map
- **Charge Boost:** Triggered when the user connects to power or maintains healthy charge habits, showing energy drinking motions.
- **Energy Saver:** Fires when low-power mode or conservation actions activate, highlighting mindful hovering.
