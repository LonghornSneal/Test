# CosmoBond StepSprite Animation Plan — Gemini GIF Workflow

## Production Approach
- **Generator:** Google Gemini video diffusion tuned for crisp cel animation with subtle motion blur streaks that emphasize locomotion.
- **Export guardrails:** 438 × 438 px, 4-second seamless loops, matte charcoal (#080A0E) background, and orthographic camera locked to showcase full-body strides without clipping complications.
- **Post-processing:** Convert outputs to 60 fps PNG stacks, brighten neon trails in Procreate, and batch assemble GIF/WebM previews alongside sprite sheets for watch integration.

## Pet Model Snapshot
- StepSprite resembles a mischievous pixel spirit made of stacked geometric blobs shaped like a running shoe silhouette.
- Palette mixes lime green, teal, and electric yellow with thin purple edge lines reminiscent of synthwave motion graphics.
- Face: wide rectangular eyes with LCD-like gradients, expressive eyebrows, and a mischievous smirk that stretches across the top module.
- Accessories include a luminous sweat scarf, ankle charm pedometer, and floating step rings that orbit the torso.
- Size: roughly two-thirds of the dial width, hovering just above the complication strip; body language perpetually in mid-stride.

## Interaction Map
- **Goal Celebration:** Fires when the user hits the configured daily step target, translating energy into fireworks-like kicks.
- **Manual Feed Burst:** Triggered when the user manually adds steps/energy via the Quick Feed tile, showering StepSprite with snack-like pixels.

## Animation States

### Idle State — "Glowstride Drift"
- **Title:** Glowstride Drift
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Base geometric body glides in place with neon lime gradients pulsing from toe to heel.
  - LCD eyes glow teal with a calm half-lid; the smirk flickers gently like an equalizer.
  - Scarf trails form soft S-curves behind the pet, fading into translucent pixels.
  - A minimal treadmill ribbon floats beneath, showing subtle parallax arrows.
  - Floating step rings rotate slowly, casting moving reflections on the torso.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite leans forward, toe lightly tapping the ribbon while micro sparks pop under the ankle charm.
  2. It glides back, eyes narrowing playfully, and the scarf trails wrap around the torso creating a temporary swirl.
  3. The pet lifts its knee, holding a jogger pose as the floating step ring dips to illuminate the underside with lime light.
  4. A gentle sway shifts weight side to side, causing the ribbon arrows to pan in the opposite direction.
  5. The knee lowers, scarf unfurls, and the LCD eyes flash a wink before softening again, closing the loop.

### Interaction State — Goal Celebration "Streak Spark Fireworks"
- **Title:** Streak Spark Fireworks
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body glows white-hot with neon yellow outlines; edges sprout short comet tails.
  - Eyes expand into full circles showing spinning star icons; smirk becomes a wide grin with pixel teeth.
  - Step rings explode into radial fireworks while the scarf becomes a waving pennant stamped with "100%".
  - Props: scoreboard tile with animated number roll and confetti bursts shaped like sneaker silhouettes.
  - Body extends upward mid-leap, toes pointed downward.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite crouches deeply, compressing like a spring while the scoreboard ticks toward the goal number.
  2. It rockets upward, leaving a zigzag neon trail and scattering sneaker-shaped confetti from the scarf pennant.
  3. Mid-air, both arms shoot outward, launching the step rings as bursting fireworks that pulse cyan to yellow.
  4. The pet kicks its heel back, tracing a heart made of footsteps, while the scoreboard flashes "Goal!".
  5. It lands with a soft bounce, generating concentric ripples on the ribbon before snapping back to the crouch for another celebratory jump.

### Interaction State — Manual Feed Burst "Pixel Snack Recharge"
- **Title:** Pixel Snack Recharge
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Colors shift toward mint and pastel purple with shimmering gradients crawling upward like energy drinks fizz.
  - Eyes widen into rectangles showing animated plus signs; mouth forms an excited "o".
  - Floating snack cubes resembling tiny energy bars orbit around, dripping neon sauce.
  - Scarf curls inward to funnel the cubes toward StepSprite’s core.
  - A translucent bowl labeled "Manual Feed" hovers nearby, continually refilling from the top of the frame.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. The bowl tips, spilling glowing cubes that spiral toward the pet while it clasps its hands in anticipation.
  2. StepSprite inhales, drawing the cubes through the scarf funnel into its torso, making the center pulse bright mint.
  3. It spins 360 degrees, scattering excess particles that form momentary glyphs resembling step counts.
  4. The pet stomps twice, sending shockwaves along the ribbon and causing the ankle charm to flash "+250".
  5. Energized, it slides sideways, eyes sparkling, before returning to the intake pose to loop the feeding moment.

### Sick State — "Idle Slump Fade"
- **Title:** Idle Slump Fade
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Palette desaturates to pale lime and gray, with jagged flicker artifacts at the edges.
  - Eyes droop with dimmed LCD lines; smirk flips into a shaky frown.
  - Scarf hangs lifeless, nearly touching the ribbon; ankle charm blinks a warning amber.
  - Background ribbon slows to a crawl and darkens to charcoal.
  - A cracked step ring droops beside the pet, dripping static.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite collapses into a seated pose, legs tucked, while the cracked ring sways like a pendulum.
  2. It sighs, releasing a faint mist of pixels that immediately fall to the ribbon without sparkle.
  3. The pet tries to stand, wobbling, and clutches its midsection as the scarf barely lifts.
  4. Exhausted, it leans back against an invisible wall, eyelids fluttering, before slumping forward again to restart the loop.

### Happy State — "Orbit Hop Parade"
- **Title:** Orbit Hop Parade
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body becomes transparent neon glass filled with twinkling stars; edges shimmer rainbow.
  - Eyes are joyful crescents with animated sparkle trails; smile widens showing pixel dimples.
  - Step rings split into three smaller orbits that dance around in synchronized rhythm.
  - Props: tiny cheering holographic avatars along the ribbon waving flags.
  - Scarf curls into a musical note, accenting each hop.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite skips sideways, leaving luminous footprints that blossom into flowers.
  2. It claps overhead, causing the orbiting rings to chime and flash pastel colors in sequence.
  3. The pet spins while mid-hop, scarf note wobbling like a metronome, and winks directly at the viewer.
  4. It lands on both feet, knees bending deeply before springing back into the first skip, keeping the parade continuous.

### Runaway State — "Trailblaze Escape"
- **Title:** Trailblaze Escape
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Colors stretch into long gradient streaks; edges fragment into pixel shards flying backward.
  - Eyes focus straight ahead with narrowed determination; mouth compresses into a thin line.
  - Scarf becomes a streaking comet tail; ankle charm glows solid red.
  - Ribbon disintegrates beneath the pet, replaced by a vast grid receding into darkness.
  - Direction arrows flash urgently, pointing toward the top-right corner where a portal flickers.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite glances back sadly while the ribbon fractures under its feet.
  2. It accelerates diagonally upward, leaving a blazing trail that ignites the grid.
  3. The portal opens, emitting cyan light that stretches the pet’s silhouette as it approaches.
  4. Just before crossing, it drops a single step ring behind like a token goodbye, then disappears into the portal as the scene resets.

### Death State — "Dusty Footprint Dissolve"
- **Title:** Dusty Footprint Dissolve
- **Pet Visual Description:**
  - Body turns translucent gray with faint lime embers glowing within; lines soften to watercolor edges.
  - Eyes close, eyelashes barely visible; mouth relaxes into a straight peaceful line.
  - Scarf gently wraps around the torso like a blanket; ankle charm darkens completely.
  - Ribbon transforms into soft sand, collecting impressions of the pet’s final stance.
  - A single glowing footprint sigil hovers above, projecting subtle rays.
- **Action Sequence:**
  1. StepSprite bows its head, hands clasped, as the neon within the body dims to embers.
  2. The sand ribbon rises to cradle it, creating a shallow imprint beneath the feet.
  3. The scarf unwinds and drapes over the shoulders like a shroud while small grains lift and swirl upward.
  4. The body dissolves into sparkling dust that follows the grains, leaving only the glowing footprint sigil gently pulsing before the loop restarts.
