# Beat Chase manual checklist

- Play/pause gating: start only when playback is active with BPM/tempo present; pause immediately on playback stop or ambient entry; resume on playback restore without timer jumps.
- Win/lose paths: timer starts at 10s, caps at 200s through specials, lose on 0s or 3 misses, win triggers the Club Carousel animation path.
- Reduced-motion + haptics: toggle ensures calmer assets and haptics off; verify tap ring/overlay stay visible without vibration when reduced motion is enabled.
- No-media path: with no playback metadata or paused media, game stays in Idle/Silence Pause and pet stats remain frozen.
- Safe overlays: tap target ring, streak arc, and miss dots sit clear of complications/time on both round and square previews; taps outside the ring should not trigger the mini-game.
