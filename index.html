### index.html
The single HTML file that loads the entire interface. It contains:
- A centered title and search bar on the main contents page.
- A collapsible sidebar for patient information entry.
- A nested list of topics and subtopics. Each entry has a rotating blue arrow to expand or collapse subtopics.
- Navigation buttons (back, forward, home) positioned in the top right.
- A persistent history button that shows previously accessed content.
All UI elements are assigned IDs or classes so the JavaScript files can manipulate them.
