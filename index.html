- Header with app title and a search bar. (The search input may have an id like "searchInput" for scripts to access.)
- Navigation controls in the top-right corner (Back, Forward, Home buttons; e.g. IDs "btnBack", "btnForward", "btnHome").
- Sidebar toggle button in the top-left to open the patient info panel (e.g. id "patientInfoToggle").
- Patient Info sidebar panel: a form for patient data (age, weight, etc.), initially hidden. For example, the panel container might have id "patientInfoPanel", and form fields could have IDs like "patientAge" and "patientWeight".
- Main content area: a nested list of topics and subtopics (e.g. a <ul id="topicsList"> with <li> items). Each topic that has subtopics shows a right-arrow icon, which rotates down when the section is expanded. Final subtopics (leaf nodes) are clickable entries that display detailed content.
- Detail sections: content containers for each final subtopic (hidden by default, revealed when that topic is selected). Each detail section might have a unique id (e.g. "detailEpinephrine" for the Epinephrine content).
- History panel: a hidden dropdown/section listing recently viewed topics, triggered by a History button (id "btnHistory"). Selecting an item from this list navigates to that topic’s detail view.
- Script includes: the JS files are linked at the bottom of the HTML (just before </body>). They must appear in the correct order so that dependencies load first and `main.js` runs last to initialize the app.
- Link to CSS: the <head> section includes the stylesheet (e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">) for overall app styling.

notes: index.html
The single HTML file that loads the entire interface. It contains:
- A centered title and search bar on the main contents page.
- A collapsible sidebar for patient information entry.
- A nested list of topics and subtopics. Each entry has a rotating blue arrow to expand or collapse subtopics.
- Navigation buttons (back, forward, home) positioned in the top right.
- A persistent history button that shows previously accessed content.
All UI elements are assigned IDs or classes so the JavaScript files can manipulate them.

Main HTML file for the single-page application. This defines the structure of the app’s user interface. It includes:
1.) The header area with the app title and a search bar (for quick lookup of topics). 
2.) The search input field is set up to trigger suggestion dropdown as the user types.
3.) The navigation controls in the top-right corner: Back button, Forward button, and a Home button (these are always visible for navigation, possibly as icons or simple buttons).
4.) A sidebar toggle button in the top-left that expands the patient info input panel. This button (often shown as an icon or text like “Patient Info”) opens a form where the user can input patient-specific data.
5.) The patient info sidebar (initially hidden or collapsed) containing input fields (e.g. age, weight, allergies, etc.) and possibly checkboxes or selectors for patient conditions. This panel’s HTML form elements are included here and will be shown/hidden via CSS/JS when the toggle is clicked.
6.) The main content area which contains the hierarchical list of topics and subtopics (the “Contents” list). This may be structured as nested <ul> lists or <div> sections. Each top-level topic is a clickable element with a blue arrow icon (pointing right by default) next to it. Subtopics are nested inside their parent topic’s container; those with further subtopics also have an arrow. Final subtopics (leaf nodes with no children) are represented as clickable buttons or links that trigger the display of detailed content.
7.) Detailed content sections for each leaf topic. These can be included in the HTML (possibly as hidden <div> elements for each subtopic’s content) or dynamically generated. Each detail section contains rich content: text details, images, videos, links, and interactive elements (like collapsible text segments or mini sub-lists). Initially, these detail sections are hidden; they become visible when the corresponding topic is selected.
8.) The history panel trigger (e.g., a History button/icon, likely near the nav buttons) which, when clicked, will show a scrollable list of previously viewed topics. The HTML may include a hidden dropdown or modal for this history list, to be populated by JavaScript.
9.) Script references to all the JavaScript files (placed just before the closing </body>). The scripts are included in a specific order (detailed in the README section) to ensure proper dependency loading. Each script is a separate file in the js/ folder, and they execute in sequence to initialize the app.
10.) Link to the main CSS file in the <head> to apply the overall styling before the content is rendered.
